# Authoring Microteia extensions

Kernel contract **2.106.0**. Everything here describes the platform installed next to this
directory, not a general idea of it.

The types travel with the SDK, but they travel *stripped of their comments*: `tsc` will tell you that
`TemplateField` has an `autoValue`, and only this document will tell you what one is for. So the shape
comes from your editor, the meaning comes from here, and the exact declaration of anything named below
comes from the MCP server — `describe_sdk_type` for the declarative side, `describe_host_module` for
what a view may import.

## 1. What an extension is

A declaration. A single JSON document that says *what should exist* — screens, automations, actions,
scripts, pages, translations, a theme — which the platform reads and installs. The platform has no
knowledge of your extension: it only knows the points you contribute to.

Two consequences you should take seriously:

- **You never modify the platform.** There is no patch, no hook into internals, no override. If
  something seems to require changing the kernel, you are looking at the wrong extension point.
- **Uninstalling has to be clean.** Anything your extension declares can be withdrawn. That is why
  option lists travel as *declarations* and not as data: the options belong to the organization, and
  removing your extension must not delete them.

### Reach for the least powerful thing that works

The order is not a style preference — each rung costs strictly more than the one above it, forever:

| Rung | What it costs |
|---|---|
| A **screen**, its fields, its rules and its expressions | nothing. The platform draws the list, the detail, the form, the filters, the search |
| A **Widget DSL** page, tab or widget | nothing. It cannot break, needs no review, and survives platform upgrades untouched |
| A **workflow**, **action** or **script** | runs in the platform's own engine and sandbox; no review, but now there is logic to keep right |
| A **view** or **startup** — real React | an administrator must read the source and trust it, again on every change (§7), and you own that code across upgrades |
| A **Cloud Function** — `manifest.backend` | the extension stays inert until someone provisions the organization's Firebase project (§14) |

Most of what looks like it needs the fourth rung needs the first. A field that computes itself, a
button that hides for the wrong person, a list filtered by who is looking — all of those are
declarations.

## 2. The loop

Two loops, and the outer one comes first.

**Model the domain, then generate.** A screen is not an entity model: a screen shows fields, an entity owns them. A business request describes what
someone will SEE, and the fastest reading of it produces one entity holding everybody else's data —
a sale carrying the customer's name, e-mail and phone, three numbered product slots, and no way to
total anything. That package validates, installs and runs; nothing else here will refuse it. So the
refusal happens earlier:

    microteia://entities          # resource: what already exists here
    validate_domain_model         # the gate: a model with an ERROR goes no further
    generate_artifact_plan        # what must exist, reconciled against what is already here

The model has two halves and one gate. The entities are the first; the second is `behavior` — the states a
record moves through, what moves it, and who may (§8.0.1). Do not wait to be asked for "the automation": the
lifecycle arrived in the same sentence as the structure.

Read `catalogSources` in those answers before trusting the list of entities: without an exported
snapshot of the installation, what the organization itself built is invisible to them (§16).

Those three are MCP tools (§16). The model's shape is the resource `microteia://domain-model/schema`,
and every check it runs is `microteia://domain-model/rules` — both derived from this installation.
§8.0 below is the short version.

**Then the package loop:**

    npx microteia-plugin create                   # scaffold, guided
    npx tsc --noEmit                              # types
    npx microteia-plugin check hello/plugin.ts    # the gate
    npx microteia-plugin build hello/plugin.ts    # writes dist/<id>.json
    npx microteia-plugin build --all              # every extension here, examples/ left out

`check` is not an approximation of the platform's validation — it *is* the platform's validation, the
same function, the same messages. If `check` passes, the package installs.

`tsc` also checks `examples/`, so the editor can resolve them. An error there is ours, not yours:
leave the file alone — the next `sync` replaces it — and report it with kernel contract
2.106.0. What must be clean is everything outside `examples/`.

Then import the `.json` from `dist/` on the **Extensions** screen. Every extension built here lands
in that one folder — `--out <dir>` sends it elsewhere — and `.gitignore` keeps it out of version
control.

`--all` works for `check` and `build` alike (`npm run check:all`, `npm run build:all`): it
takes every `plugin.ts` in this directory, reports every extension that fails rather than stopping
at the first, and refuses two folders that declare the same id — both would write the same file.
`examples/` is left out unless you add `--examples`.

An imported extension is used there — activated, installed, published to the catalogue — but never
edited or downloaded: its source is *your* `plugin.ts`, not the copy in the organization. To change
it, raise `manifest.version`, build, and import the new `.json` over the old one. The platform
refuses an import whose id belongs to an extension created on that organization's own *Create
extension* screen, since that would replace an editable source with a closed copy.

## 3. The package

```ts
import type { AuthoredPlugin } from '@microteia/sdk';

export default {
  manifest: { id, version, kernel, name, publisher, contributes, /* dependencies, backend, ... */ },
  summary: 'One line, shown in the Extensions list.',
  workflows: [],       // required, may be empty
  screens: [],         // entities, with their fields
  screenPatches: [],   // fields added to a screen that already exists
  lookups: [], tagLists: [],
  actions: [], scripts: [],
  reports: [],         // questions asked of the data
  views: [],           // pages delivered as code
  startup: '',         // code that runs once when the extension loads
  migrations: [],      // converting data an earlier version of YOURS wrote
  overview: {},        // a rich description, in Widget DSL
} satisfies AuthoredPlugin;
```

Every field except `manifest`, `summary` and `workflows` is optional, and a package may be any
subset — a single automation is a legitimate extension.

**Two types, one letter apart, and it matters.** `AuthoredPlugin` is what you write — it lets a view
point at a file with `sourceFile`. `MarketplacePlugin` is what the platform installs, where every
view carries its `source` inline. The compiler turns the first into the second. Write against
`AuthoredPlugin`; reach for `MarketplacePlugin` only when you are reading a built `.json` back.

### Identity and versions

`manifest.id` is reverse-DNS and permanent: it is how an update recognises the thing it updates. Use
a domain you control. `manifest.version` is semver. `manifest.kernel` is the range of platform
contracts you work against — `^2.106.0` for what is installed here.

`manifest.category` is optional and free — `'Theme'`, `'Integration'`, whatever files your
extension usefully. The Extensions list derives its category filter from what the listed packages
declare, so a category nobody used before appears there on its own. Like `name` and `summary`, it
may be a message reference (`label('category.reports')`): you translate what you name.

`manifest.image` is the logo the Extensions list shows next to the name — a base64 `data:` URI of
a PNG, JPEG, WebP or SVG, at most 64 KB. A web address is refused: the
package carries everything it shows, and a remote image would tell a third-party server who opened the
list. Without an image the list draws `manifest.icon`, and without that, the icon of the first menu
entry or page the extension contributes. Installs, stars and the verified-publisher seal are not
declared: the platform counts and grants them.

### Prefix

`manifest.prefix` starts every name your extension creates in the organization that installs it. A
collection — screen, option list, tag set, a field you add to someone else's screen — takes it with
`_` (`acme_client`); an automation, action, script, report or document template takes it with `-`
(`acme-notify-client`). 2 to 8 lowercase letters or digits, starting with a letter.

Why it exists: the collections of an organization are ONE namespace. Two extensions that both create
`client` cannot live in the same office, and the installation refuses the second one rather than
renaming it — a renamed collection would silently be read by whoever expected the declared name.

- `create` asks for the prefix once, records it in `package.json` under `microteia.prefix`, writes it
  in the manifest and in the names it generates.
- Declared, it is enforced: `check` and the installation refuse a created name that does not start
  with it. Absent — extensions written before it existed — nothing is refused, and `check` warns.
- It never changes. An update with another prefix is refused: it would rename everything you created.
- The id of the extension must be inside the directory's namespace (`microteia.namespace`). An id
  outside it is refused by `build` — the copy of somebody else's extension still carrying their id.
  An id that was published before the namespace existed goes in `microteia.keepIds`.

Requires kernel `^2.50.0`; an older kernel ignores the field.

Every change to an extension raises `manifest.version`, and records itself as one entry at the top of
that extension's `VERSIONS.md` — the file `create` generates next to `plugin.ts`. The entry is
written for whoever *uses* the extension: what they will notice, in one plain sentence, never the file
or the field you touched. An extension changed without a new version is an extension that never reaches
the organizations that already have it: the version is the whole of how an update is recognised.

### References between your own artifacts

Inside the package, artifacts point at each other by `templateId` (automations, actions, scripts) or
`key` (screens), never by real id — the real ids are generated at install time and differ per
organization. `check` refuses a reference that leads nowhere.

To point at a *screen* another extension installs, declare what that extension brings:

```ts
dependencies: { 'com.example.projects': { version: '^2.0.0', collections: ['projects'] } }
```

### References to another extension's artifacts

An automation, an action or a script of another extension is named
`<extension-id>/<source-id>` — the id of the extension that owns it, then the `templateId` it
carries in its own package. A local id is never enough: it is generated at install time and the
organization may already have that name taken, so what survives the trip is the owning extension
plus the source id.

```ts
import { artifactRef } from '@microteia/sdk';

// in the manifest
dependencies: { 'com.example.utils': '^1.0.0' },

// in a step
configuration: {
  scriptId: { kind: 'Literal', value: artifactRef('com.example.utils', 'normalize-tax-id') },
}
```

Two conditions, and both are refused when unmet:

- **You declare the dependency.** `check` refuses a qualified reference whose extension is not in
  `dependencies`.
- **They declare the export.** Only what the owning extension lists in `manifest.exports` may be
  referenced. An extension that declares no `exports` exposes nothing — every artifact of it stays
  private. This is what lets you rename an internal helper without breaking someone else.

```ts
// in the owning extension's manifest
exports: ['normalize-tax-id', 'notify-customer'],
```

If the owning extension is not installed, installation is refused and names it. Nothing is resolved
at packaging time: the reference travels as written and the engine resolves it by name on every run,
so it survives the owner being updated or reinstalled.

**You do not have to know the name of anything to write one.** Read `microteia://referenceable` — it
lists every artifact this directory can see another extension exporting, already in the form the
reference takes, and each line says which `kind` it is, because the kind decides where it fits:

    com.example.utils/normalize-tax-id — Normalize tax id (script, authored here)

Two sources feed it, and the difference matters. A `plugin.ts` **in this directory** — the sibling being
authored beside yours — is the truth of now, and it is the case no snapshot can know about, because that
extension is not installed anywhere yet. An extension from `installed-catalog.json` is what the
organization runs, as of the day the snapshot was taken. `describe_workflow_step` says the same thing on
the input that takes the id, filtered to the kind that fits there.

`check` confers the whole gate from here, not half of it: the reference's shape, the declared
dependency, **and** whether the owner really exports that id at the version you asked for.

**The range is a promise about versions you have not seen yet.** On `0.x`, `^0.1.0` admits only
`0.1.x`: the day the owner ships `0.2.0`, an extension that declared `^0.1.0` stops loading in the
organization that updates it — installed, listed, and off. `check` compares every declared range with
the sibling `plugin.ts` in this directory (and with installed-catalog.json), and on the owner's side it names
the sibling whose range the new version leaves; both are warnings. Installing an update that leaves an
installed extension outside its range asks the organization to confirm, naming the extension and the
range. While your extensions are on `0.x`, declare the range you mean — `'>=0.1.0 <1.0.0'` — rather
than a caret that closes at the next minor. What it will
not invent is an absence — an owner this directory cannot see comes back as "cannot be checked here",
with what to run to close the gap, never as a refusal.

## 4. Extension points

| Point | API | Accepts | Many? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ui.page` | 1.0.0 | `code`, `widget` | yes |
| `ui.nav` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `ui.nav.group` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |

| `i18n.messages` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `theme.definition` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `theme.tokens` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `access.permission` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `access.resource` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `access.requirement` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `auth.provider` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `time.business.calendar` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |
| `portal.view` | 1.3.0 | `code`, `widget` | yes |
| `notification.category` | 1.0.0 | _declaration only_ | yes |

The `Accepts` column is the important one. Four kinds of implementation exist:

| Kind | What it is | Who may use it |
|---|---|---|
| `widget` | a declarative tree the platform renders (Widget DSL, §6) | anyone |
| `workflow` | one of the automations in your package | anyone |
| `script` | code in the server-side sandbox | anyone |
| `code` | a React component, delivered as source | anyone — **but see §7** |

Prefer `widget` when it is enough. A declarative page needs no review, cannot break, and survives
platform upgrades without you touching it.

### Making the shell your own

Two points let an installation look like itself rather than like the platform, and neither asks for
code. `ui.slot` puts content into a named region of the shell — `sidebar.header` · `sidebar.footer` · `top-bar.left` · `top-bar.right` · `status-bar.left` · `status-bar.right` — and
`ui.menu` adds an entry to a menu, today `user-menu`.

A menu entry declares what it does through `action`: `{ kind: 'openTab', tabKey }` opens a tab a
`ui.page` draws, `{ kind: 'openTab', screen }` opens the list of one of your screens (the same target
as `nav()`, see "Where a menu entry leads" below), `{ kind: 'url', href, newTab }` opens an address.
Nothing else runs — which is why the menu is open to a package that ships no JavaScript at all.

Both are toggled and ordered by the organization, from Settings, under the region's own key
(`<surface>.slots`, `<surface>.items`). Declare `order` and `defaultEnabled` and you have said
where it starts; where it ends up is theirs to decide.

### A tab inside a record — including another extension's

Every record detail hosts a tab surface of its own, addressed by the screen's `sourceId`:
`recordSurface('<sourceId>')` returns `record:<sourceId>`. Contribute a `ui.tab` there with
`surfaceTab` or `surfaceTabSpec` and it appears after Data, Notes and Documents, on saved records
only, in the same list as the child-screen tabs — the organization orders and toggles both together in
Settings, and by default child screens come first. Address the `sourceId`, never the installed key: an organization that already had a screen
with the same `sourceId` keeps its own key, the `sourceId` does not change. A screen of another extension is fair game — declare
that extension in `dependencies`.

A `code` tab receives `RecordTabProps` from `@microteia/data`: `recordId`, `record` (as stored,
and re-rendered when it changes), `collection` and `screenSourceId`. A `widget` tab receives no
data, as on every surface. To list the children of the open record, pass
`parent: { fieldKey, recordId }` to `useEntityList`: the list is locked to that record, its
actions see `surface: 'parentTab'`, and `openNewRecord()` opens the form with the field filled in.
Their `relation` is `owned` when `fieldKey` is the screen's declared ownership OR a `required`
field — a link that cannot be emptied is never offered as Unlink, so the card shows Delete — and
`related` only when the link is optional.

The other side of a many-to-many link gets the same lock. Pass `parent: { fieldKeys: [...], recordId }`
and a record enters when ANY of those fields points at `recordId` — equality on a single `reference`,
"contains" on one with `multi: true`: the projects a person works on, the deals where a company is a
party on either side. `openNewRecord()` fills the FIRST field (a one-id list when it is `multi`).
Unlink takes `recordId` out of every field that points at it — out of the list on a `multi` field,
leaving the other ids — and `relation` is decided per record: a `required` `multi` field that
still has other ids stays `related`, and turns `owned` only where `recordId` is its last id. Only a
lock by ONE single field hides that field from the card and the filters, because there every record
has the same value; a `multi` field or a second field tells something, and stays. Requires kernel
`^2.51.0`. Draw `filteredRecords` — the list after the person's filter, in
the order of `sortRecords` —, and keep `records` (the whole list, same order) for counting, finding by id
and totals; declare `sortRecords` instead of sorting by hand.

**Beyond the window.** `records`, `useCollection` and the `records` a command or mention provider receives
hold the newest 500 of a collection, and an organization with thousands outgrows them silently: a
count over them is wrong from the next one on, and a name built from them is missing for anyone older.
Six doors reach the rest (kernel `^2.97.0`):

- `useEntityList(sourceId, { paginate: true })` — the list fetches 50 at a time and the next 50 when
  `loadMoreRef` scrolls into view (`RecordListSurface` places it), and the person's filter goes to the
  server. `records` is then only what was fetched — do not count or look up by id in it. Show
  `windowNotice` under the list. Ignored with `sortRecords`.
- `useRecordsByIds(collection, ids)` — the records a card points at, by id, fetched when missing.
- `useRecordCounts(collection, groups)` — a dashboard number counted on the server, one group of
  conditions per number.
- `useRecordSums(collection, field, groups)` — a dashboard total of a currency or number field, summed on
  the server, one group of conditions per total (kernel `^2.99.0`).
- `useRecordsWhere(collection, conditions, { orderBy, limit })` — the records a dashboard card shows
  ("due this week"), queried on the server and live, at most 500 (kernel `^2.98.0`).
- `context.recordMatches` in a command or mention provider — what the server search found for the
  query, already in `context.records`, to be offered even when the title does not contain the query.

A condition is an equality (`{ field, value }`, `op` `'in'` or `'array-contains'` when needed) or, from
kernel `^2.98.0`, a day range on a date field (`{ field, from, to }`, `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, both ends
inclusive, either optional) — one per query. "Overdue" is `[{ field: 'status', value: 'pending' }, { field:
'dueDate', to: yesterday }]`, with the days built from `today()` and `dayOf()`. An equality together with a
range, or an `orderBy` on another field, needs a composite index — one per direction of the order: declare
it in `manifest.backend.indexes` (`collectionGroup` is the collection's name, `queryScope: 'COLLECTION'`), and
`provision` deploys it with your package.

The organization toggles and orders these tabs from Settings (`<surface>.tabs`). `check` refuses
`record:` with no `sourceId`, and warns — without refusing — about a `sourceId` it
cannot find in your package, in a dependency authored beside it, or in the installation snapshot.
`examples/record-tab-example` has both kinds of tab, and the list locked to the open record.

### Notification types

`notificationCategory({ key, title, description?, icon?, variables? })` declares a TYPE of notice your package sends —
"deadline approaching", "contract ending". It is data only. A `notify` step that sets
`category: '<package id>/<key>'` sends that type, and each person chooses on the Notifications page by
which channels (app, e-mail, browser) it reaches them — muting your type never mutes the others. Write
the title and message as message references, never fixed text: they are translated for each recipient.
List in `variables` the `messageParams` keys your notices carry (`['client', 'dueDate']`): the organization
uses them, as `{client}`, when it writes its own text for your type and each channel in Settings >
Notifications > Templates — besides `{title}`, `{message}` and `{tenant}`, which every notice has.

### Your own screens in the portal

People from OUTSIDE the organization — a client, a supplier — see what screens declare in `portal`
(the `subject`, the `fields` that leave, `visibleWhen` for which records leave, `create` for what
they may submit, `edit` for what they may change, `uploads` for the documents they may attach). The
portal draws a home, a menu and a standard list and record for them. `portalView(metadata, viewKey)`
adds yours:

| `surface` | Also declare | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `list` / `detail` | `collection` | replaces the standard list, or the open record, of that collection |
| `page` | `key`, `title`, `icon`, `order` | a page of its own, with an entry in the portal MENU |
| `widget` | `key`, `title`, `order` | a card on the portal HOME |
| `home` | — | the whole home, in place of the standard one |
| `layout` | `key`, `title` | the whole SHELL — where brand, menu and the guest's account sit |

`order` is a suggestion. The organization decides what shows and where, in Settings > Portal — the
menu's order and which entries and cards are visible. Your package never forces a place.

#### A card on the home with no code — `portalWidgetSpec`

A view is code: it reaches guests only where the organization trusts your package's code, and every
change asks for that trust again. Most home cards only filter and list what the guest already sees —
the invoices about to fall due, the appointments booked, the notices still to open. Declare those instead:

```ts
portalWidgetSpec({ key: 'attention', title: label('portal.attention'), order: 10 }, {
  body: [
    { type: 'row', children: [
      { type: 'count', collection: 'notices', when: 'status == "sent"', tone: 'danger' },
      { type: 'text', text: label('portal.to-open'), tone: 'muted' },
    ] },
    { type: 'records', collection: 'notices', when: 'status == "sent"',
      orderBy: { field: 'tacitDate', direction: 'asc' }, limit: 5, empty: label('portal.nothing'),
      card: [{ type: 'title' }, { type: 'field', field: 'tacitDate', label: true }, { type: 'field', field: 'companyId' }] },
    { type: 'section', title: label('portal.by-company'), children: [
      { type: 'records', collection: 'companies', card: [
        { type: 'row', justify: 'between', children: [
          { type: 'title' },
          { type: 'count', collection: 'notices', when: 'status == "sent"', scope: 'record', size: 'md' },
        ] },
      ] },
    ] },
  ],
})
```

The tree is the one `portal.template` uses (`row`, `stack`, `section`, `spacer`, `divider`, `text`,
`icon`), plus two nodes that read the records the guest already has:

| Node | Draws |
|---|---|
| `records` | the records of a portal screen (`collection`) that pass `when`, sorted by an exposed field (`orderBy: { field, direction? }`; without it, the most recently updated first), up to `limit` (default 5, at most 20). Each one is a card that opens the record: the screen's own portal card, or yours in `card`. `layout` and `minWidth` as in `template.card`; `empty` is the text when none passes |
| `count` | how many records of a portal screen pass `when` — the number, in the guest's format (`size`, `tone`) |

- **Two scopes.** The card of the widget is about no record: `title`, `field`, `fields`, `summary`, `updated` and
  `hiddenWhen` only go inside the `card` of a `records` node, where they answer about that record exactly as
  in `template.card`. There, a `count` with `scope: 'record'` counts only the children of that record —
  the notices of each company of a guest who represents two. A `records` node never goes inside another
  card: the whole card opens the record.
- **It only reads what the guest has.** `collection` names the COLLECTION of a screen in the portal (its
  `dataCollection`, or its key). `when`, `orderBy` and the card may only read EXPOSED fields of that
  screen. `when` is evaluated in the guest's browser over the projection, in the organization's time zone
  (`today()` works), and an expression that fails lets nothing through. The server drops a whole
  `records` or `count` that reads anything else — not just its filter, which would let through records you
  meant to leave out — and a card that reads data and loses all of it does not reach the guest.
  `check` refuses the package for any field of its OWN screens; a screen of another package (the
  portal package built over somebody else's screens) is checked only for shape, and the server does the rest.
- **It shows nothing rather than nothing-to-see.** A `records` with no record passing and no `empty`
  disappears, and so does the card left with nothing to draw: "no notices to open" is the absence of
  the card, unless you say it with `empty`.
- **Counted over a window.** The portal keeps the 200 most recently updated records of each screen; a
  `count` over a full window is a floor and shows as "200+", and `records` chooses inside it.
- Fixed text is a `label('…')` reference, translated by the server into the guest's language — no view
  of yours, and no code trust, involved.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.90.0"`. An older kernel discards the contribution and the
  card would simply be missing, so `check` refuses the package without it.

#### A page of text in the menu with no code — `portalPageSpec` and `markdown`

Every portal has pages that are only text, and the text belongs to the organization more than to your
package: terms of use, the privacy notice, frequent questions, contacts, the law that applies. Declare the
page — an entry in the portal menu drawn by the same tree as the home card — and put the text in a
`markdown` node:

```ts
portalPageSpec({ key: 'help', title: label('portal.help.title'), icon: 'question', order: 30 }, {
  body: [{ type: 'markdown', content: label('portal.help') }],
})
```

- **`content` is a message REFERENCE, never the text.** The text lives in your `i18n.messages` bundles, one
  per language. `check` refuses literal text: it would not translate, and the organization would have
  nothing to edit.
- **The reference may be of ANOTHER namespace.** A page declared by your portal package can show a text that
  a separate, text-only package brings — `@com.acme.legislation/portal.law`, with each city or client
  installing its own `com.acme.legislation.<city>` that contributes only that bundle (it installs like a
  translation package). Nothing checks that the key exists when you build: it exists where it is installed.
- **No text, no page.** The server resolves the text in the guest's language, falling back like every
  message (`pt-BR` → `pt` → `en`). When no installed package — and no edit of the organization —
  has it, the `markdown` node is dropped, and a page (or home card) left with nothing to show stays out
  of the portal instead of showing the raw reference.
- **The organization can replace it.** Whoever holds `portal.content` edits the text in Settings > Portal
  texts, per language, with a preview; the edit wins over your bundle in that language, only in that
  organization, and "bring back the package text" undoes it. Every change goes to the audit log. Only the
  content of `markdown` nodes is editable there — titles and short `text` stay yours.
- **Safe Markdown only.** Headings, emphasis, lists, tables, quotes and links (opened in a new tab). Raw HTML
  and images are not drawn: the text reaches people outside the organization, and comes from a package the
  organization did not have to trust.
- `markdown` also works in a home card (`portalWidgetSpec`), but never inside the `card` of a `records`
  node — that whole card is a button. Put `records` and `count` next to the text when the page needs data.
- The page is one more menu entry: the organization shows, hides and orders it in Settings > Portal, like
  a page of code. A code page with the same `key` wins.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.92.0"` — for the page, and for a home card with
  `markdown`. An older kernel discards both, so `check` refuses the package without it.

The standard create and edit form fills a field the way the organization's form does. A `masked`
field types into the template of its `mask` preset, and a field with `logic.onChangeLookup` runs
that lookup as the guest types, writing the answer through `map` (or `targetPrefix`) — only into
fields the guest may fill on that form; any other target is dropped. The server resolves both from the
extensions ENABLED in the organization, since the portal does not load them: a preset or provider no
enabled extension declares leaves the field as plain text, with no lookup. Nothing to declare beyond
the field itself — the provider's request goes out from the guest's browser, as it does from the
organization's.

A `reference` in `create.fields` or `edit.fields` whose target screen is IN the portal is chosen,
not typed: the form lists the records of that screen the guest already sees, by title, the way it lists
the record the new one belongs to. That is how a guest creates something tied to two records of theirs —
the reply to a notice of their company, the complaint about one of their orders:

```ts
fields: [/* ... */ { key: 'company', type: 'reference', refEntity: 'companies' },
  { key: 'notice', type: 'reference', refEntity: 'notices' }],
portal: { subject: { field: 'company' }, fields: ['text', 'notice'], create: { fields: ['text', 'notice'] } },
```

- The server checks every id it receives in such a field — from the standard form, `usePortalSubmit` or
  `usePortalUpdate` — against what the guest sees NOW, and refuses the whole write with the same answer
  as a link the guest does not see. On an edit, an id the record already held is not checked again: the
  organization may have set it, and saving another field must not fail because of it.
- `multi: true` is a multiple choice; every id is checked.
- `usePortalScreen(collection)` tells your own form which fields these are (`reference: { collection,
  multi }` on the field): offer the records of `usePortalRecords(reference.collection)`.
- A field's `optionsFilter` reaches the portal form only when the portal can answer it: every compared
  field is a top-level field of that same form (create and edit are separate forms) and, on a reference,
  every `path` is a field the target screen exposes. The standard form applies it to the options and clears
  a choice it no longer offers; your own form reads it as `optionsFilter` on the field and compares with
  the record's `data`. Otherwise it is not sent and every option is offered — a filter the guest cannot
  answer would empty the list, and answering it from a field the guest does not see would leak it.
- A `reference` to a screen that is NOT in the portal stays what it always was — a text box whose value is
  written as typed. The guest sees no record of that screen, so there is nothing to choose from: keep
  such fields out of `create.fields` and fill them in the organization, or by a workflow.

**Who may create — `create.when` and the guest's role.** Every guest of a record has the same power
over it until you say otherwise. A partner and the accountant of the same company, the building manager
and a resident: when only some of them may create, give the invitation a ROLE and the screen a condition:

```ts
portal: {
  subject: { field: 'company' },
  fields: ['name', 'status'],
  create: { fields: ['name', 'document'], when: '"partner" in actor.portalRoles' },
},
```

- The role belongs to the LINK between the guest and a subject record, not to the person: whoever is a
  partner of one company may be the accountant of another. It is set when inviting — `role` on the
  `portal-invite` step (section 10), or the Role box in Settings › Portal — and it is a key: lowercase
  letters, digits, `_`, `-` and `.`, up to 40 characters. Show the people a label of your
  own; compare the key.
- `when` is a field expression on the WHOLE record the new one belongs to (the company, the invoice) —
  including fields that never leave the organization — plus `actor`: `actor.portalRoles` is the list of
  roles the guest holds on THAT record (empty without one), `actor.verified` what they proved when
  signing in. It is a list because a record may belong to two subjects; ask `"partner" in
  actor.portalRoles`. `actor` hides a field of the same name.
- The server checks it on every creation, and the standard shell asks the server before drawing the
  "new" button and the list of records to create under. False or invalid, the guest does not create —
  closed. Absent, every guest who sees the record creates, as before.
- In `portal.actions`, `hiddenWhen` and `disabledWhen` read the same `actor` on the portal. Neither
  `edit.when` nor `visibleWhen` do: they are evaluated when the record is written, once for every guest
  who sees it, and there is no "who" then.
- The role is access, not identity: it does not reach the workflow a guest's action runs — the condition
  of the screen is where the decision lives.
- A view that draws its own "new" gesture reads `usePortalScreen(collection).create.conditional` and,
  when it is `true`, offers it only for the parents `usePortalCreateTargets()(collection, ids)` returns.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.89.0"`. An older kernel ignores the condition and would let
  every guest create, so the package gate refuses it.

A portal view reaches a smaller API: `@microteia/ui`, `@microteia/i18n`, `@microteia/format`,
`@microteia/theme` and `@microteia/portal` — `usePortalRecords(collection, { parent })`,
`usePortalRecord`, `usePortalScreen`, `usePortalNavigation`, `usePortalDocuments`,
`usePortalSubmit`, `usePortalCreateTargets`, `usePortalUpdate`, `usePortalActions`. Show an edit gesture only when the record's `canEdit` is true
(`usePortalNavigation().edit` opens the standard form). `usePortalNavigation().openRecord(collection,
recordId)` opens a record from any surface: inside a menu entry (a `list`, `detail` or `page`) it
stacks the record over what is open, and Back returns there; from the home (a `widget` or the `home`)
it takes the guest to the record's own address — the one the e-mail and the bell use —, and Back returns
to the home. `back()` with nothing open does nothing. Importing `@microteia/data` (or report, settings, functions) fails when the view is
compiled: the guest has none of the organization's data stores. A view receives `{ collection, recordId? }`
and asks `@microteia/portal` for the rest.

It is sent to the guest only when the organization trusts your package's code — the same trust the
Extensions screen shows. Without it, the standard page is drawn.

#### A layout of your own

The kernel draws two shells — a side menu (the default) and a top menu — and the organization picks one,
or yours, in Settings > Portal. A `layout` view receives the page as `children` and decides only where
things go; what the page shows is never its business. Everything else comes from `usePortalShell()`:

```tsx
import { usePortalShell, PortalBrand, PortalUserMenu } from '@microteia/portal';

export default function CompactLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const shell = usePortalShell();
  return (
    <Frame>
      <Bar>
        <PortalBrand name={shell.tenant.name} logoURL={shell.tenant.logoURL} onClick={shell.goHome} />
        {shell.menu.map((item) => <Entry key={item.id} $active={item.active} onClick={() => shell.openEntry(item.id)}>{item.title}</Entry>)}
        <PortalUserMenu shell={shell} />
      </Bar>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </Frame>
  );
}
```

`shell` carries the brand, the menu, the page title, the guest (whose name is the account's), the themes
("Automatic" plus the platform's own themes — the themes the organization installed do not reach a guest, who
is not a member —, remembered in the browser), switching
organization, signing out, and the open/closed state of a drawer (`navOpen`, `toggleNav`) and of the
account menu. `PortalUserMenu` already offers all of it. A layout that draws its own account corner
must offer the theme and signing out — and must keep the menu reachable.

#### The portal is used on a phone first — design for it

Most guests open the portal on a phone. The portal is responsive, and your view has to be too:

- **The shell owns the menu.** Below 900px the standard shells fold the menu into a drawer opened from
  the top bar. A page, list, detail or widget never draws a menu of its own and never uses
  `position: fixed` — that belongs to the layout. A `layout` of yours must keep the menu reachable on a
  phone the same way.
- **Fluid widths.** No fixed widths and no horizontal scroll: use `width: 100%`, `minmax(0, 1fr)` grids
  and `flex-wrap`. Grow into columns with `@media (min-width: 768px)`, never the other way around —
the content area is about 1040px wide at most.
- **A card is narrow.** A `widget` takes the whole width on a phone and half of it on a computer —
  keep it to a number, a short list or one call to action.
- **Tap targets of at least 44px** (`theme.spacing['2xl']` is 48px). Text never below
  `theme.fontSizes.sm` on a phone.
- **Theme only.** Colours, sizes and spaces come from the theme — the guest picks "Automatic" or one of the
  platform's own themes, in light or dark; the themes the organization installed do not reach a guest.
- **Check it at 360px wide** before publishing.

#### Records for every guest — `subject: 'public'`

Some information belongs to the organization and is meant for everyone it lets in — the system's
outages, general notices, the holiday calendar, a fee table. Declare that screen `public`: every ACTIVE
guest of the organization reads its records, whatever record they were invited to.

```ts
portal: { subject: 'public', fields: ['date', 'hours', 'description'], visibleWhen: 'published == true' }
```

- `fields` and `visibleWhen` work as on any screen: only those columns, only those rows.
- **Read-only.** Its records belong to no guest, so there is no one a created record would belong to, nor
  who would answer for an opened one: `create`, `edit`, `uploads`, `actions`, `documents`, `documentLinks`, `trackViews`, `invites` are refused
  on a public screen — the package gate says which.
- **It does not spread.** A screen whose `subject` reaches a public one (`'parent'`, `{ field }`) reaches
  no guest through it — its records are not in the portal. A child of a notice is not a notice unless its
  own screen says so.
- **The name of a linked record** (an exposed `reference`) shows only when it points to another public
  screen, or when you list it in `referenceTitles`: the title another screen exposes is for ITS guests.
- A guest cannot pick a public record in a `reference` they fill, and a `notify` with `portalGuests` about
  a public record reaches no one — telling every guest is a mailing, not a notice.
- It appears in the portal menu like any screen — the organization may hide or reorder it —, and a
  declared home card or page (`records`, `count`) and `usePortalRecords` read it like any other.
  `PortalScreen.public` is `true` on it.
- Guests must be signed in: there is no page served to someone who has not entered the portal.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.94.0"`. An older kernel does not know the subject and
  drops the whole declaration: the screen would silently leave the portal, so the package gate refuses
  the package without it.

#### Which records leave — `visibleWhen`

`fields` decides which COLUMNS leave; `visibleWhen` decides which ROWS. A screen that mixes the
internal and the external — revenue and expenses for the same client, an accountant's entries, a
clinical note next to the appointment — keeps the internal ones inside:

```ts
portal: { subject: { field: 'client' }, fields: ['description', 'amount', 'dueDate'], visibleWhen: 'type == "revenue"' }
```

- It is a field expression (section 9) on the WHOLE record, fields the guest never sees included,
  evaluated by the server every time the guest's copy is written. False, or invalid, and the record has
  no copy in the portal; if it had one, it is deleted. A field the record does not have is `null`, so
  `officeOnly != true` lets through the records where nobody checked it.
- **A hidden record cuts the chain.** A record that reaches the guest THROUGH a hidden one — the child
  of `subject: 'parent'`, the item that points at it — does not appear either. On the `'self'` screen
  it hides the subject itself, and everything that belongs to it.
- It is evaluated when the record is WRITTEN, not when the guest looks. Do not make it depend on the
  clock (`today()`): the answer would only change on the next write.
- A guest's own records obey it too: write the condition so that what they create passes — or it
  disappears from their portal the moment it is saved.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.61.0"`. An older kernel ignores the condition and
  would show every record, so the package gate refuses the package without it.

#### Document links that expire — `documentLinks`

A shared document reaches the guest as a link. Without this declaration it is the file's PERMANENT link:
whoever keeps it opens the file forever, revoked invitation included. When what you deliver is evidence
or secrecy — a tax notice, a medical report, a legal act —, ask for short-lived links instead:

```ts
portal: { subject: { field: 'company' }, fields: ['number'], documents: true, documentLinks: { expiresInMinutes: 10 } }
```

- Each time the guest opens a document, the server checks the invitation, the record and the share mark
  NOW, and hands out a signed link valid for `expiresInMinutes` (1 to 60;
  anything else means 10). Revoking the invitation makes the links already
  handed out useless as soon as they expire — no link outlives that window.
- **Permanent links handed out before are replaced.** Turning it on starts a pass over the screen's records
  that swaps the download token of every document that was ever shared; the office's own links follow
  the new token. A document shared for the first time afterwards keeps its token — it never left.
- A `file` field in `fields` stops reaching the portal: its value IS a permanent link. The package
  gate does not refuse it; the organization's Portal tab says so.
- Nothing changes for your views: `usePortalDocuments().open` already asks for the link at click time.
- The functions sign with the service account they run as, which needs
  `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` — the same permission `microteia grant-signing` grants for signing in.
  Without it the guest cannot open documents of that screen, and the log of `getPortalDocumentUrl`
  says why.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.77.0"`. An older kernel ignores the declaration and
  would hand guests the permanent link, so the package gate refuses the package without it.

#### Knowing that a guest opened it — `trackViews`

Reading the portal leaves no trace on the server by default: the guest's browser reads its copy of the
record directly. When the opening itself matters — the notice that counts as delivered once opened, the
report the patient must have seen —, ask the server to record it:

```ts
portal: { subject: { field: 'company' }, fields: ['number'], documents: true, trackViews: true }
```

- **Opening a record** of that screen in the portal (the built-in detail or your `detail` view) and
  **getting a document link** of one of its records each write an Audit trail entry and publish
  `<collection>.portalViewed` (section 10), with the guest as the actor and the server's clock. The
  record is not changed.
- **A document is only handed out after it is recorded.** If recording fails, the guest does not get the
  link. The record opening is reported by the portal shell — the server cannot see a direct read —, so
  treat the DOCUMENT as your evidence and the record opening as a signal.
- The same guest opening the same record (or the same document) again within 30 minutes
  is recorded once.
- A `list` or `page` view that shows a record's content by itself is not an opening the kernel can see.
  Put what must be proven behind the `detail` surface or in a document.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.79.0"`. An older kernel ignores the declaration and records
  nothing, so the package gate refuses the package without it.

#### A one-click act on the open record — `actions`

Some things a guest does are a GESTURE, not an edit: accept the terms, confirm the appointment, sign
the receipt. Behind `edit` they become "Edit, tick, save", and nobody understands what is expected.
Offer the record's own action instead:

```ts
actions: [{ templateId: 'act-accept', key: 'accept', title: '@my.ns/action.accept', icon: 'check',
  workflowId: 'wf-accept', confirmMessage: '@my.ns/action.accept.confirm',
  hiddenWhen: 'surface != "portal" or accepted == true', enabled: true, danger: false, order: 0 }],
screens: [{ ..., viewActionIds: ['act-accept'],
  portal: { subject: 'self', fields: ['name'], actions: ['accept'] } }],
```

- `portal.actions` lists action KEYS, in button order, taken from the actions the screen already places
  on the record (`viewActionIds`). The key, not the `templateId`: it crosses installation unchanged.
  The guest sees the title, icon, confirmation and `danger` you gave the action.
- `hiddenWhen` and `disabledWhen` are evaluated by the SERVER on the WHOLE record — fields the guest
  never sees included — with `surface == "portal"`, `isNew == false`, no permissions
  (`hasPermission(...)` is false) and `user.id` = the guest. They are checked again when the guest
  clicks: a hidden or disabled action does not run. An expression that fails hides (or disables) the
  action. Use `surface` to keep a guest's gesture out of the organization's header, or the reverse.
- The workflow runs AS THE GUEST (`via: 'portal'`, the verified identity when there is one) and receives
  what it receives in the organization: `action`, `source`, `context` — the stored record, never
  what the browser sends —, `recordId` and `isNew: false`.
- Only the `status` (code and message) reaches the guest. `result` and the local commands (`merge`,
  `save`, `refresh`…) are for the organization's form and are ignored: change the record in the
  workflow, and the portal shows the change when it is projected again, seconds later.
- Only actions that run a workflow and do not ask for parameters can be offered: a `command` or
  `promptParameters: true` is refused by the package gate, as is a key that is not on the record.
- The buttons appear on the built-in detail and above your `detail` view. To place them yourself — in
  your `detail` view, or on a home card about one record —, call
  `usePortalActions(collection, recordId)` from `@microteia/portal`: it returns `actions` (title, icon,
  `confirmMessage`, `danger`, `disabled`), `loading`, `running` and `run(actionId)`. `run` does not
  ask — show `confirmMessage` first — and never rejects: it resolves to `{ code, message }`, the message
  ready to show. Calling it for a record removes the portal's bar from above your view, so the gesture
  appears once. Requires the same kernel as `portal.actions`.
- The outcome is a passing notice at the top of the portal, over any layout — yours included, with no
  change —, never a line on the record: a message saying what will happen must not stay on screen after
  it has. `success` leaves after a few seconds, `warning` a few more, and `error` stays until the guest
  closes it. So word the workflow's message for the moment ("Acceptance recorded."); what stays true
  belongs on the record, as a field. When you draw the actions yourself, show `run`'s result in the same
  place with `usePortalNotify()` from `@microteia/portal`:

  ```ts
  const notify = usePortalNotify();
  const result = await run(action.id);
  notify(result.message, result.code === 'SUCCESS' ? 'success' : result.code === 'WARNING' ? 'warning' : 'error');
  ```

  It takes any text already in the guest's language, from any portal view. Requires
  `kernel: "^2.87.0"`.
- Every click is a workflow run: `disabledWhen`/`hiddenWhen` are what stop the second one — write them.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.81.0"`. An older kernel ignores the declaration and shows
  no button, so the package gate refuses the package without it.

#### The name of a linked record — `referenceTitles`

An exposed `reference` field reaches the guest as the TITLE of the record it points to — when that
record's screen is in the portal and exposes its title field. Otherwise it arrives with no name: pointing
at an internal screen (the employee in charge) does not take their name along. The guest never sees the
stored id, and neither does the record's own title when the title field is that reference.

When the guest should see the name without the screen going to the portal — the taxpayer on the
registration, without the taxpayer screen and its tax id, address and phone — list the field:

```ts
portal: {
  subject: { field: 'company' },
  fields: ['holder', 'status'],
  referenceTitles: ['holder'],
}
```

- Only the value of the target's title field leaves — no other field of it, and the guest cannot open it.
- The field must be in `fields` and be a `reference`; anything else refuses the package.
- The label follows the target: rename the taxpayer and every projection showing the name is refreshed. Do
  not copy the name into the record with a workflow — that copy is what this replaces.
- A screen whose `titleFieldKey` is this reference gets the same name as its title in the portal list and
  in the notice the organization receives when a guest creates or changes it.
- A link to THAT screen carries the same name, with nothing else to declare: the notice pointing at the
  registration shows the taxpayer, because the registration's title already does. Undeclared, it is the
  title the target shows in the portal — so the target must expose its title field and its name. Listed
  here, it is the target's title as the organization reads it. One extra step only: a title that is a
  reference to a record whose title is again a reference arrives with no name.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.84.0"`. An older kernel ignores the declaration
  and the link reaches the guest with no name, so the package gate refuses the package without it.

#### How the portal draws the screen — `template`

Leave it out and the portal draws what it always does: a card per record with the title, the first
fields and the update date, and an open record with the title, the edit button, the actions and every
exposed field. Declare it when some field deserves emphasis, or the record reads better grouped:

```ts
portal: {
  subject: { field: 'company' },
  fields: ['number', 'amount', 'status', 'dueDate'],
  template: {
    card: {                                   // the top list AND the tab inside the parent record
      layout: 'grid',                         // 'list' (default in the portal) or 'grid'
      minWidth: 'sm',                         // grid column: 'sm' | 'md' (default) | 'lg'
      accent: { field: 'status' },            // top stripe: the color of the chosen option
      body: [
        { type: 'row', justify: 'between', children: [{ type: 'title' }, { type: 'field', field: 'status', variant: 'badge' }] },
        { type: 'field', field: 'amount', variant: 'strong', size: 'xl' },
        { type: 'text', text: label('portal.overdue'), tone: 'danger', hiddenWhen: 'status != "late"' },
      ],
    },
    detail: {                                 // the open record, above the tabs
      body: [
        { type: 'row', justify: 'between', children: [{ type: 'title', size: 'xl' }, { type: 'edit' }] },
        { type: 'section', title: label('portal.totals'), children: [
          { type: 'field', field: 'amount', label: true, variant: 'strong', size: 'xl' },
          { type: 'field', field: 'dueDate', label: true, icon: 'calendar' },
        ] },
        { type: 'actions' },
        { type: 'fields', exclude: ['amount', 'dueDate'] },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

| Node | Draws |
|---|---|
| `row`, `stack`, `section` | children side by side / one under the other / in a framed block with an optional `title` |
| `spacer`, `divider` | pushes the rest of a row to the end / a line |
| `title` | the record title, as the portal shows it (`size`) |
| `field` | one EXPOSED field, formatted by its type. `label: true` shows its label, a `label('…')` reference shows that text; `variant`: `text`, `muted`, `strong` or `badge` (the chosen option as a colored badge); `size`; an empty field takes no space unless `showEmpty` |
| `fields` | the exposed fields, label and value — the standard open record. `exclude` drops the ones you already emphasized |
| `summary`, `updated` | the standard card's line of first fields / "Updated on …" |
| `text`, `icon` | fixed text (`tone`, `size`) / an icon of the catalog |
| `edit`, `actions` | open record only: the edit button (when `edit` lets this guest change this record) / the actions (`actions`) |

- **It arranges; it never exposes.** Every field it names must be in `fields`; a `hiddenWhen` may only read
  exposed fields, because it is evaluated in the guest's browser over what the guest has. The server drops
  any node that breaks this before the guest receives the design, and `check` refuses the package.
- **It arranges; it never switches off.** An open record that does not place `edit` or `actions` still
  shows them, where they always are. The tabs (children, documents) always come after the body.
- Fixed text is a `label('…')` reference, translated by the server into the guest's language — your
  package's messages reach the portal this way, with no view of yours involved.
- A portal view of your own (`portal.view`) wins over the design: code owns what it draws.
- A kernel older than 2.88.0 ignores the declaration and draws the standard portal,
  so no `kernel` range is required. The organization can redraw it in the Form Design (Portal tab).

#### Links point at the collection

A link in the portal — the `refEntity` of `subject: { field }`, the `parentEntity` of
`subject: 'parent'` — names the COLLECTION the records live in, as every link does. The portal
follows it to the screen that is in the portal for that collection, whatever its key.

That matters for a screen over a collection named apart from its key (`dataCollection`): installing it
also writes a bare screen under the collection's own name, so the organization has two screens over the
same records, and only yours declares `portal`. Point at the collection (`parentEntity: 'sites'`),
not at your screen's key — the installed key is the organization's own when it already had a screen with
the same `sourceId`, and the parent's record tabs are found by the collection too.

Requires `kernel: "^2.62.0"`. An older kernel stops at the bare screen,
and the records behind that link reach nobody.

#### Who lets a guest in — `invites`

A guest is invited to a record of the `'self'` screen by someone with `portal.manage`, in Settings >
Portal. When the invitation should follow a record of yours instead — the representative whose
registration was approved, the patient who confirmed the first appointment —, the screen opens that door
to automations:

```ts
portal: { subject: 'self', fields: ['name'], invites: { automation: true } }
```

Then the `portal-invite` and `portal-revoke` steps (section 10) may give and remove access to its records.
Only the `'self'` screen takes it. It is a decision about what leaves the organization, so it lives in the
declaration — which only someone with `portal.manage`, or whoever installs your package, writes — and not
in who happens to trigger the flow. Requires `kernel: "^2.73.0"`.

`examples/portal-example` has the declarations on five screens — one of them over a `dataCollection` —,
a `detail` page, a home card, and the contacts of a client invited by a workflow.

### Settings whose options are the organization's data

A `select` in a `settingsSection` takes either `options` — a closed list, written in your package —
or `optionsFrom`, never both. `optionsFrom` reads the options from a collection of the organization,
so a choice keeps up with what the office renames, recolours and adds:

```ts
{
  key: 'orders.recent.statuses',
  label: label('settings.recent.statuses'),
  type: 'select',
  multi: true,
  optionsFrom: { kind: 'lookup', collection: 'orderStatuses' },
  default: ['open'],
  scopes: ['tenant', 'user'],
}
```

| `kind` | Options | Value stored | Label | Colour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lookup` | an option list | the option KEY | the option label | the option colour, when the list has one |
| `entity` | the records of a screen | the record ID | the screen's `titleFieldKey` | — |

**The value is exactly what the matching field stores on a record** — a `select` field with that
`lookupCollection` stores the key, a `reference` field stores the ID. That is the whole contract:
your view compares the setting with the record using `===`, with no translation in between. An
option created by the office has the same key and label; an option you seed may not
(`pending` / "Pending"), and the key is what you compare.

`multi: true` makes the value a `string[]` (it works with closed `options` too). Read it with
`useSettingValue`, or with `useSettingChoices` from `@microteia/settings`, which also gives each
chosen value's label and colour — so a card title can name the statuses it shows without reading the
list again.

`collection` follows the rule of every other reference: in your package (`lookups` or `screens`) or
in a declared dependency (`collections`), and `check` refuses one that leads nowhere. Name a screen
of your package by its key, as a field would: the platform finds the installed screen even when the
office already had it, with the same `sourceId`, under another key.

What the editor does, so you do not have to: it is the record form's own control, so options keep
their colours and several values show as removable chips. A value whose option or record no longer
exists stays stored, shows as missing, and can be removed — validation checks the SHAPE of the value,
never whether it still exists. Someone who cannot read the screen of an `entity` source sees the
setting disabled, with the reason. An option list is vocabulary, readable by every member.

`check` also refuses `optionsFrom` or `multi` outside a `select`, and a `default` of the wrong
shape (a list with `multi`, a text without). A kernel older than these two draws such a `select`
with no options, so a package that uses them starts its `kernel` range at the version it is built
with. `examples/settings-example` has one property of each kind.

### Signing in — including your own SSO

`auth.provider` declares a way of signing in, and it takes no implementation at all. The protocol
is already configured in the project's Firebase Authentication; what your package adds is the NAME of
it. Kinds: `password` · `google` · `facebook` · `microsoft` · `apple` · `github` · `oidc` · `saml`.

`oidc` and `saml` are the two where you choose the provider, and both require `providerId` — the
id as configured in Firebase (`oidc.acme`, `saml.acme`). Miss it and the contribution is dropped
rather than drawn: a button that does not know whom to talk to locks out whoever clicks it.

`flow: 'redirect'` leaves the page and comes back, instead of opening a window. Use it wherever the
window is blocked — a hardened corporate browser, an iframe, an embedded app.

`password` is the platform's own e-mail-and-password form, declared through the same point — by the
kernel itself, together with `google`, so both are ALWAYS offered. An extension cannot withdraw them:
`defaultEnabled: false` hides only a provider of the package that declares it, and a contribution reusing
the key `password` does not hide the kernel's. An installation that requires single sign-on cannot hide
the form today; it adds its provider beside it.

The sign-in screen runs ABOVE the organization: there is no tenant, no settings document and no
permission there. So sign-in methods are decided by what is DECLARED, never by a setting — and the
regions it hosts (`login.header`, `login.footer`) drop any slot that asks for a permission.

**Which means installing your package is not enough.** An installed extension is read from the
organization, and before sign-in there is no organization to read it from. A package that contributes
before sign-in has to be STAMPED into the installation: list its built `.json` in `login.extensions`
in `microteia.yaml`, and `microteia deploy` puts it in the site itself.

Stamped packages load UNTRUSTED — only declarations apply, and `views` do not run. That is not a
restriction to work around; it is what lets an installation put your SSO live without anyone reviewing
your code. And stamping is not installing: to also work inside the organization, the package has to be
installed there too.

#### The portal signs in differently — and it is not yours to declare

`auth.provider` is the sign-in of the INSTALLATION: providers configured once in the project's Firebase
Authentication, for the people who work there. A portal guest belongs to ONE organization, and that
organization chooses how its guests prove who they are, in Settings > Portal > Sign-in:

- the **e-mail link** (on by default) — it only proves the guest reads that mailbox;
- up to a few **OpenID Connect providers** of its own — issuer, client, scopes, and the claims each one
  verifies. The server is the OIDC client: authorization code with PKCE (S256) always, the client
  secret never reaches a browser, and the ID token is checked against the provider's published keys
  (signature, issuer, audience, expiry, nonce) before anything else happens.

A guest who signs in through a provider gets an account that exists only in that organization — never
the account of the invited e-mail, and never the same account in two organizations. That is what makes
it safe for an organization to configure an issuer: what its provider attests is worth nothing outside it.

An invitation may require an attribute the guest has to PROVE (`requiredClaim: { name, value, normalize? }`,
`normalize` one of `digits`, `lowercase`). It is accepted only by a sign-in
whose provider verifies that claim with the same value; anything else is refused and recorded in the
Audit trail. `email` and `phone_number` only count when the provider marks them verified. Turning the
e-mail link off suspends, at once, every guest who signs in by e-mail.

There is nothing to declare for any of this, and nothing a package may name: no provider is known to the
kernel by name. What reaches your code is the result — see `actor.verified` (section 9) and the
`portalVerified` field of records the guest saves (section 10).

### How you contribute to one

A contribution is one entry of `manifest.contributes`. Use the constructor for the point instead of
assembling the object: it stamps the API version and derives a **stable id** from your key, and that
id is the whole of how an update recognises the same contribution across versions.

| Constructor | Point | What it delivers |
|---|---|---|
| `nav(metadata)` | `ui.nav` | a menu entry — ONE target (`key`, `screen` or `screenSourceId`, below), `label`, `icon`, `order`, optional `badge`, `filter`, `group`, `requiredPermissions` and `requiresSystemAdmin` |
| `navGroup(metadata)` | `ui.nav.group` | a titled, collapsible group of the sidebar — `key`, `label`, `order`, optional `defaultCollapsed`; entries join it with `group: '<key>'` (below) |
| `page(metadata, viewKey)` | `ui.page` | a workspace screen drawn by one of your `views` (§7) |
| `widgetPage(metadata, spec)` | `ui.page` | a workspace screen declared in Widget DSL — no code, no review |
| `surfaceTab(metadata, viewKey)` · `surfaceTabSpec(metadata, spec)` | `ui.tab` | a tab on a surface, as code or as Widget DSL |
| `surfaceWidget(metadata, viewKey)` · `surfaceWidgetSpec(metadata, spec)` | `ui.widget` | a widget on a surface, as code or as Widget DSL |
| `surfaceSlot(metadata, viewKey)` · `surfaceSlotSpec(metadata, spec)` | `ui.slot` | content in a named region of the shell, as code or as Widget DSL |
| `menuItem(metadata)` | `ui.menu` | an entry in a menu — the `action` *is* the contribution, so no code is involved; `openTab` takes ONE of `tabKey`, `screen` or `screenSourceId` |
| `authProvider(metadata)` | `auth.provider` | a way of signing in, corporate SSO included — declaration only |
| `recordAction(metadata, viewKey)` | `ui.record.action` | a gesture over one record, next to the platform's own |
| `command(id, metadata, viewKey)` | `ui.command` | an entry in the command palette |
| `settingsSection(section)` | `ui.settings` | a section of the Settings screen — the properties *are* the contribution |
| `messageBundleContribution({ locale, namespace, messages })` | `i18n.messages` | the words, one bundle per locale (§5) |
| `themeTokensContribution(spec)` | `theme.tokens` | colour and typography tokens |
| `accessPermissionContribution` · `accessRequirementContribution` · `accessResourceContribution` | `access.*` | what people can do (§13) |
| `lookupProviderContribution` · `fieldRulePresetContribution` | `data.*` | an external source of options; a reusable field rule |
| `pointContribution(point, id, metadata, apiVersion)` | any | a point published by *another* extension, which cannot have a constructor here |

Two fields every contribution accepts, and both are easy to miss:

- **`when`** — accepted by the type and evaluated by no surface: the contribution is always present, and
  `check` warns when one declares it. Gate what a contribution shows inside it, or with the point's own
  condition (an action's `hiddenWhen`, a badge's `when`).
- **`priority`** — who wins when several contributions land on the same single-valued point.

Metadata for a screen, a tab or a widget also takes **`requiredPermissions`**: a list, and **one** of
them is enough. Absent, the contribution shows for every member. This is what keeps a menu entry from
leading someone to a screen they cannot read.

### Icons — a closed vocabulary

Every `icon` in a package is a **key from the platform's catalogue** — a screen, a nav entry, a tab,
a widget, a menu item, an action, a list-card field (`ui.list.icon`) and the extension itself all draw
from the same 267 keys. They are not Remix names, not Material names, and not
free text.

Guessing one costs nothing while you write: the platform draws a generic marker for a key it does not
recognise, so nothing throws and nothing logs — the mistake first appears on the screen of whoever
installed the extension. `check` refuses it instead, naming the icon and where it was written.

Ask the MCP server for `list_icons` (resource `microteia://icons`) for the list this installation
actually draws. It is:

`apps`, `dashboard`, `home`, `homeSimple`, `homeOffice`, `building`, `buildingSimple`, `building3`,
`building4`, `government`, `bank`, `hospital`, `store`, `store2`, `store3`, `scales`, `scales2`,
`scales3`, `briefcase`, `briefcase2`, `briefcase3`, `briefcase4`, `briefcase5`, `contract`,
`contractLeft`, `contractRight`, `shield`, `shieldCheck`, `shieldStar`, `shieldUser`,
`shieldKeyhole`, `shieldCross`, `shieldFlash`, `policeCar`, `policeBadge`, `idCard`, `criminal`,
`spy`, `accessibility`, `file`, `fileText`, `fileList`, `fileList2`, `fileList3`, `fileChart`,
`fileCheck`, `fileClose`, `fileEdit`, `fileAdd`, `fileCopy`, `link`, `linkUnlink`, `deleteBin`,
`fileDownload`, `fileUpload`, `fileSearch`, `fileLock`, `fileShield`, `fileWarning`, `fileDamage`,
`filePaper`, `filePdf`, `fileExcel`, `fileWord`, `fileZip`, `fileImage`, `fileMusic`, `fileVideo`,

`bookSimple`, `book2`, `bookmark`, `bookmark2`, `bookShelf`, `newspaper`, `news`, `history`,
`mail`, `mailSend`, `mailOpen`, `mailAdd`, `mailCheck`, `mailLock`, `mailStar`, `mailVolume`,
`phone`, `smartphone`, `cellphone`, `message`, `message2`, `message3`, `chat1`, `chat3`,
`chatSmile`, `questionAnswer`, `megaphone`, `sendPlane`, `contactsBook`, `contacts`, `headphone`,
`volumeUp`, `mic`, `user`, `user2`, `user3`, `userSmile`, `userStar`, `userSettings`, `userSearch`,

`inbox`, `barChartBox`, `layoutGrid`, `flowChart`, `cursor`, `sparkling`, `more`

## 5. Text — the rule that has no exception

Every label a person reads is a **reference**, resolved at render:

```ts
const label = (key: string) => `@com.example.hello/${key}`;

fields: [{ key: 'title', label: label('field.title'), type: 'text', required: true, order: 0 }]
```

and the words themselves are a contribution:

```ts
import { messageBundleContribution } from '@microteia/sdk';

contributes: [
  messageBundleContribution({ locale: 'en', namespace: 'com.example.hello', messages: EN }),
  messageBundleContribution({ locale: 'pt-BR', namespace: 'com.example.hello', messages: PT_BR }),
]
```

Ship `en` always — it is the source language, and what someone sees when no translation for their
locale is installed. **The platform does not translate your vocabulary.** "Document type" is the
platform's concept; *Power of attorney* and *Petition* are yours, and only you can answer for them.

A key with no translation renders as the key itself. Ugly, diagnosable, and never a blank screen.

A key takes only letters, digits, dot and hyphen, starting with a letter or digit: `option.not-enabled`,
never `option.not_enabled`. Anything else is not a reference to the platform — the label renders
exactly as written, and the bundle entry is dropped. `check` refuses both sides.

What the organization *typed* — a screen they named, a list option they added — is their data. It
passes through untranslated, always.

Everything declarative takes a reference: a field's `label`, `placeholder`, `section` and
`listLabel`, a lookup's `label`, a screen's `titleSingular` and `titlePlural`, a nav entry's
`label`, an action's `title` and `confirmMessage`, a migration's `name`, `summary`, and every
string in an `overview`. Inside a *view*
the equivalent is `useT` from `@microteia/i18n`, reading the same bundles.

## 6. Widget DSL — interface with no code

A tree of nodes the platform renders with its own components. It carries no JavaScript, so nothing
about it needs reviewing, nothing about it can break the page, and it keeps working across platform
upgrades without you republishing anything.

It is used in five places: `overview` (the extension's own description in the Extensions screen),
`manifest.license` (your licence terms — see below), `widgetPage`, `surfaceTabSpec` and
`surfaceWidgetSpec`.

### `manifest.license` — the terms you set

```ts
manifest: {
  // ...
  license: {
    type: 'stack',
    gap: 'md',
    children: [
      { type: 'markdown', content: label('license.body') },
      { type: 'banner', message: label('license.warranty'), variant: 'warning' },
    ],
  },
}
```

Optional, and it reaches the reader in two places: behind the licence icon on the extension's card in
the **Extensions** screen — where anyone can read it *before* installing — and, once the extension is
installed and active, reproduced in full on the organization's **Terms** page, under the Microteia
Terms of Use. Uninstalling or deactivating it takes the terms off that page, because they stop
applying.

Write it with references, like every other string: a licence the organization cannot read in its own
language is the one document in the package where that matters most.

**Which licence is yours to decide.** Microteia is licensed under the GNU AGPL v3 or later, but its
`NOTICE` carries the *Microteia Extension Exception*: an extension that talks to the platform only
through the published interfaces — the package format, this SDK, the curated `@microteia/*` host API,
the sandbox, and the office functions API — is not covered by the platform's licence. Proprietary,
permissive or copyleft: you choose, and `manifest.license` is where you say it. The exception also lets
you copy code from `examples/` into your extension under your own terms. What it does not cover is a
change to the platform itself: that stays under the AGPL.

| Node | |
|---|---|
| `stack` | A vertical stack. `gap?: 'sm' \| 'md' \| 'lg'`, `children`. |
| `grid` | A responsive grid. `columns?: number`, `children`. |
| `heading` | A section title. `text`. |
| `text` | A paragraph. `text`, `muted?: boolean`. |
| `markdown` | A block of Markdown. `content`. |
| `metric` | A big number with a caption. `label`, `value`. |
| `keyValue` | A list of label/value rows. `items: { label, value }[]`. |
| `banner` | A notice. `message`, `variant?: 'info' \| 'warning'`. |
| `divider` | A rule between blocks. No properties. |
| `report` | A report from the organization's catalogue, by name. `report` is its key. It names the report instead of embedding the query on purpose: an inline query would put aggregation, permission and scan limits inside a layout DSL, and give you a second place to declare what a number means. |

```ts
widgetPage({ key: 'hello', title: label('page.hello'), icon: 'star' }, {
  type: 'stack',
  gap: 'lg',
  children: [
    { type: 'heading', text: label('page.hello') },
    { type: 'markdown', content: label('page.hello.body') },
    { type: 'keyValue', items: [{ label: label('kv.owner'), value: label('kv.owner.value') }] },
    { type: 'banner', message: label('page.hello.note'), variant: 'info' },
  ],
})
```

Every string in a spec is a message reference, exactly as everywhere else — every string but the
one named below, which is an identifier and not text anybody reads. The DSL has no
expressions, and it reaches data in exactly ONE way: the `report` node, which names a report from
the organization's catalogue (§11). That is what a dashboard is here — a `grid` of `report`
nodes, each one a table or a chart, with no code in it and nothing for anybody to review:

```ts
widgetPage({ key: 'sales', title: label('page.sales'), icon: 'fileChart' }, {
  type: 'grid',
  columns: 2,
  children: [
    { type: 'heading', text: label('page.sales') },
    { type: 'report', report: 'acme-invoices-by-month' },
    { type: 'report', report: 'acme-invoices-by-city' },
  ],
})
```

The node names the report by its `key`, and that key is **not** rewritten on installation the way a
collection name is — so prefix it with your extension, or you inherit whichever report of that name
the organization already had. Anything else that has to show live records is a screen (§8) or a view
(§7): there is no inline query here, for the reason the node table gives.

## 7. Code trust - why a human has to say yes

A `view` travels as **source**. The browser compiles it and evaluates it against a fixed allowlist of
modules:

- `react`
- `react/jsx-runtime`
- `react/jsx-dev-runtime`
- `styled-components`
- `@microteia/ui`
- `@microteia/data`
- `@microteia/format`
- `@microteia/i18n`
- `@microteia/theme`
- `@microteia/report`
- `@microteia/settings`
- `@microteia/functions`
- `@microteia/portal`

Any other import throws. This is an import allowlist, not a sandbox: the code runs in the page, so it
can reach `fetch` and the DOM like any script. The real containment is **provenance**.

So: a package carrying `views` or `startup` installs **inert**. An administrator of the organization
is asked whether they trust its AUTHOR — the dialog shows who published it, whether that identity was
confirmed, and what the code will be able to do; it does not show the source. Whoever needs to read the
code reads it in the package file before importing it. The trust is bound to that exact code by content
hash — change one character and it must be trusted again. Nothing you can put in the package changes this,
and you should not design as though it might.

Author views as real files:

```ts
views: [{ key: 'summary', title: label('page.summary'), icon: 'lineChart', sourceFile: './views/Summary.view.tsx' }]
```

`sourceFile` is an authoring field: the compiler replaces it with the file's contents. Keeping the
code in a real `.tsx` is what lets `tsc` and your editor check the part of the extension most likely
to be wrong.

### Grouping menu entries

The sidebar is drawn in sections. An entry with `group: '<key>'` joins the `navGroup()` with that key;
the group sits at its own `order`, on the same scale as the loose entries, and its entries follow
their own `order` inside it. The platform declares three groups — put a tool of yours in the one that
matches its purpose:

| Constant | Holds | `order` |
|---|---|---|
| `CUSTOMIZATION_NAV_GROUP` | what shapes the organization: screens, document templates, extensions | 102 |
| `AUTOMATION_NAV_GROUP` | what runs on its own: workflows, scripts, actions, data processing | 106 |
| `ADMIN_NAV_GROUP` | the organization's administration: its record, settings, translations, audit, access | 110 |

The user menu is for the person, not for tools: their profile and appearance. A tool entry belongs in
the sidebar.

- **A group key is universal**, like a screen's `sourceId`. Two packages that declare the same key
  declare ONE group, labelled and placed by whichever loads first. So you may declare a group another
  extension also declares, and join it without depending on it.
- **A group is joined by KEY, never by name.** Two keys draw two groups, even when both are called
  "Schedule". **Before declaring a group, read `microteia://nav-groups`**: every group this directory
  can see — the platform's, the `plugin.ts` files here, the first-party extensions in `examples/`
  and the extensions in the installation snapshot —, by key, with its name in each language and who
  declares it. If one already serves the purpose, declare THAT key. A new key is for a purpose no
  listed group serves. `check` and `validate_plugin` warn about a new key whose name another
  visible group already has, and about an entry joining a group nothing here declares.
- **An entry never disappears because of its group.** A `group` nobody declared in the organization
  leaves the entry loose, at its own `order`.
- **A group draws a header only with two or more visible entries.** With one, the entry stands loose in
  the group's place; with none — permissions, missing targets — the group is not drawn.
- **Collapsing is the person's choice**, remembered on their device; `defaultCollapsed` is only where
  it starts. A collapsed group still shows the entry of the open tab, and its header carries the sum
  of the hidden badges.

```ts
navGroup({ key: 'schedule', label: label('nav.group.schedule'), order: 20 }),
nav({ key: 'calendar', label: label('nav.calendar'), icon: 'calendar', order: 20, group: 'schedule' }),
```

### Where a menu entry leads

A `nav()` — and a `menuItem()` whose action is `openTab` — names exactly ONE target:

| Target | Opens | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `key: '<tab key>'` (`tabKey` in a menu action) | the tab a `ui.page` draws — by `key`, or by `keyPrefix` | a page of this package, of a declared dependency, or of the platform (`reports`, `marketplace`, …) |
| `screen: '<screen key>'` | the LIST of a screen of this package | a screen you draw no view for — usually with `hideFromSidebar` and a `badge` (§8) |
| `screenSourceId: '<sourceId>'` | the list of a screen, found by its universal id | a screen of a dependency |

**A screen's key is not a tab key.** The list of a screen lives in a tab only the installation can name:
it is the key of a screen the organization already had with the same `sourceId` (an older installation
may sit under `products_2`), and a key already taken by ANOTHER screen, list or tag set refuses the
installation — nothing is renamed. `screen` is resolved after all of
that, so the entry keeps working; you never write the tab yourself.

`check` — and the installation — refuse an entry that leads nowhere: a `key` that no page of this
package, of a declared dependency or of the platform draws. When a screen of yours has that same key,
the refusal says so and names the `screen:` you meant. A dependency `check` cannot see from here is
reported as "cannot be checked here", never refused. And if a tab still opens with no page behind it,
the workspace says so — the tab key and the extension that put the entry in the menu — instead of
showing an empty panel.

```ts
// Refused: 'recordTabMilestone' is a screen, and no page draws a tab with that key.
nav({ key: 'recordTabMilestone', label: label('nav.milestones'), icon: 'flag', order: 60 }),

// Opens the screen's list, whatever key it has in the organization.
nav({ screen: 'recordTabMilestone', label: label('nav.milestones'), icon: 'flag', order: 60,
  badge: { collection: 'recordTabMilestone', when: 'done != true' } }),
```

#### The list the entry opens — `filter`

An entry that leads to a screen's list may say how that list opens. It is what makes a queue read
right: the badge says "3", and the click shows those 3 — not the whole collection.

```ts
const WAITING = 'waiting_on_us';

nav({ screen: 'conversations', label: label('nav.conversations'), icon: 'message', order: 30,
  badge: { collection: 'conversations', when: `status == "${WAITING}"` },
  filter: [{ key: 'status', values: [WAITING] }] }),
```

- **Each term is `{ key, values }`** — the key of a field the screen declares `filterable: true`, and the
  values it accepts. An option list compares by the option KEY, never the label, the same as `when`
  does; a checkbox takes `"true"` / `"false"`; a date filters by range, `key` the first day and
  `<key>:ate` the last (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Several terms all apply; several values in one term, any of them.
- **`{ key, empty: true }` opens on the records where the field has no value**, and `empty: false` on
  those where it has one — the queue of what has not happened yet: the invoice with no payment date,
  the ticket with no owner. It takes any filterable field but a checkbox (unchecked is `"false"`, filter
  by that) and is the same empty as `isEmpty()` in `when`: absent, `null`, blank text, an empty list. The
  list shows it as the "No value" / "Has value" filter, which the person can also pick by hand; several
  fields in it must ALL be empty (or all filled). A term has `values` or `empty`, never both. Requires
  `kernel: "^2.91.0"`.
- **It is an ordinary filter**, shown in the filter bar and removable like one the person picked. It is
  where the list starts, never a restriction: the person can always widen it.
- **It belongs to the ENTRY, not to the screen.** The automatic menu entry, a saved tab and a link open
  the list unfiltered; clicking this entry again brings its slice back. Two entries over the same screen
  cannot each carry a filter — they resolve to the same tab, and the first one declared wins.
- **Write the badge and the filter over the same slice.** They are two declarations of one idea, and
  nothing keeps them in step but you: a badge counting `status == "open"` over a list opening on
  `overdue` is the mismatch this exists to close.
- **There is no relative date.** A filter is fixed values, so "overdue" (`dueDate < today()`) is a
  badge, not a filter — open that list on a status field instead.

```ts
// Sent, but not yet made available: no date in either field. The badge and the list, same slice.
nav({ screen: 'notices', label: label('nav.to-publish'), icon: 'hourglass', order: 40,
  badge: { collection: 'notices', when: 'isEmpty(publishedAt) and isEmpty(closedAt)' },
  filter: [{ key: 'publishedAt', empty: true }, { key: 'closedAt', empty: true }] }),
```

`check` refuses a filter on an entry whose target is a `key` (a page has no list to hand it to), a
key that is not a filterable field of the screen, an option key the field does not declare, a value
a checkbox or a date cannot hold, and `empty` on a checkbox. Over a dependency's screen the fields
are not visible from here, and the filter installs unchecked; an option list of the organization's (`lookupCollection`) is checked
only for the key, because its values exist only there.

### A view is not a page until something points at it

`views` is a registry, not a menu. The entry sits there, keyed, until a contribution names that key:

```ts
contributes: [
  nav({ key: 'summary', label: label('nav.summary'), icon: 'lineChart', order: 50 }),
  page({ key: 'summary', title: label('page.summary'), icon: 'lineChart' }, 'summary'),
  //     ^ the workspace tab                                            ^ views[].key
]
```

`nav` puts it in the menu; `page` is what actually resolves the view. Declaring the view and
forgetting the `page` is the most common mistake there is, and nothing fails — the extension installs
and the screen simply is not there.

Two things follow from the same wiring:

- **A page opened per record** uses `keyPrefix` instead of `key`: `page({ key: '', keyPrefix:
  'invoice-read:', title, icon }, 'invoice-read')` matches every tab whose key starts with that
  prefix, and a screen's `recordTabPrefix` is what sends a record there instead of to the form.
- **`home: true`** makes the page the workspace's start page — the tab opened when the
  organization is entered and nothing else is open. The platform names no start page of its own: with
  none declared, the workspace starts with no tab. If several are declared, the first one loaded that
  the person may see wins.
- **`nav().badge`** counts records without any code: `badge: { collection: 'invoices', when: 'status
  == "open"' }`. The expression sees each record's fields plus `user` (§9), which is what lets a badge
  count what *this* person has not dealt with. Give the entry the same slice as a `filter` (above, "The
  list the entry opens") and the click shows what the badge counted.

### Several files, one module

`sourceFile` also takes a list, merged in the order given:

```ts
views: [{
  key: 'summary',
  title: label('page.summary'),
  icon: 'lineChart',
  sourceFile: ['./views/Summary.view.tsx', './views/Summary.viewmodel.tsx', './views/Summary.styles.tsx'],
}]
```

The package still carries one source per view — the runtime evaluates one module per view, and its
`require` resolves nothing but the curated API. The list is an authoring convenience, and it changes
three things you have to know:

- **Import across the listed files normally.** The relative import is what makes `tsc` and your editor
  connect them; the compiler erases it, because after the merge the names are already in scope. A
  relative import pointing outside the list is refused at build time — the runtime could never resolve it.
- **The merged module has one scope.** A top-level name declared in two of the files collides, and the
  build says which name and which files. Importing the same thing from the same module in several files
  is not a collision: those imports fold into one.
- **Exactly one of the files exports `default`** — it is the view's component.

`startupFile` takes a list for the same reason, and so do `source` and `startup` when the code
reaches the package as text rather than as a path (a `?raw` import). There the merge cannot check a
path, so it checks names: every name a relative import brings has to be declared by one of the merged
sources, which is what catches merging the view and forgetting its view model.

The first-party extensions in `examples/` are written this way, and it is worth knowing why they look
slightly different from what you write: they travel inside the platform's own bundle, so their parts
arrive as TEXT and the plugin merges them itself with `mergeViewSources`. You have the compiler, so
you declare the list of paths and it does the merging. The split is the same; only the door differs.
Two of them are worth reading side by side — `calendar` and `news` are four files each, and
`dashboard` is one file, because a view that only renders what a hook returned has nothing to split.

`startup` receives a `host` and may return a teardown function:

```ts
export default function startup(host: ExtensionHost) {
  host.commands.register({ /* ... */ });
  return () => { /* undone when the extension is disabled */ };
}
```

It is how an extension gets into the command palette and into mentions — the things that have to
exist before anyone opens its screen. Ask `describe_host_module` for what `host` offers; do not guess.

### Writing the code, once you are sure you need it

Everything else in a package is checked before anyone sees it: a screen is validated, a workflow is
validated, an expression is validated. A view is a program, and the only thing between it and the
organization is you. So write it in the shape the platform writes its own — three files, one view:

| File | What it holds | What it may not hold |
|---|---|---|
| `Summary.view.tsx` | JSX, and nothing else: it renders what the view model returned | state, effects, computation, a `ref.current` read |
| `Summary.viewmodel.tsx` | the state, the effects, the handlers and the derived values, returned as one plain object | JSX |
| `Summary.styles.tsx` | the styled-components | anything a test would want to call |

```ts
sourceFile: ['./views/Summary.view.tsx', './views/Summary.viewmodel.tsx', './views/Summary.styles.tsx']
```

One file is enough while a view only renders what a hook already returned — do not split a component
that has nothing to split. Split it the first time it keeps state of its own, derives a value, or grows
a second screenful of styles. The reason is not tidiness: a component holding all three can only be read
by reading all of it, and what is wrong is almost always the middle part.

**Take what can be wrong out of React.** A sort order, a total, a window of dates, the decision about
which records count — those are functions of their arguments, not of a component. Give each a file of
its own, named in the list like the others, importing nothing, and a test beside it:

```ts
// views/Summary.rules.ts — imports nothing, which is what makes it callable
export const upcoming = (items: Item[], limit: number): Item[] => /* ... */;

// views/Summary.rules.test.ts — runs in "npm test", in a second
it('puts the earliest due date first', () => expect(upcoming(items, 3)).toEqual(/* ... */));
```

A rule that lives inside a component can only be exercised by rendering the component, which here means
installing the extension in an organization and looking at it. That distance is the whole reason to move
the rule out — not the file count.

**Style through the theme, never through a literal.** `styled-components` is curated, and the `theme`
it hands you is the organization's, as it is at that moment:

```ts
const Card = styled.div`
  padding: ${({ theme }) => theme.spacing.md};
  background: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.surface};
  border: 1px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.border};
  border-radius: ${({ theme }) => theme.borderRadius.lg};
`;
```

`colors`, `fonts`, `fontSizes`, `spacing`, `borderRadius`, `transitions` and `highlights` are the
groups; `describe_host_module` gives the exact token names, and a token that does not exist fails to
compile.

**Colour is the part with no exceptions.** A hex or an `rgba(...)` written into a view stops matching the
day the office switches theme — and every office eventually switches to the dark one, which is where a
literal turns from wrong-ish into unreadable. Diluting a token colour with an alpha suffix
(`theme.colors.primary + '18'`) is allowed and is not the same thing: it keeps the hue the office chose.
Inline `style={{ }}` is checked by nothing, so it is the last place a colour should be.

Spacing, type and radius come from a token **whenever a token means the same thing** — a 16px gap is
`spacing.md`, and writing it out is how two screens drift apart. A genuinely one-off geometric value
(a 34px circle, a 3px scrollbar, a 1px hairline) has no token, and inventing one nobody else shares is
worse than writing it where it is used.

Colour that **is** data is the other side of the same rule: the colour someone picked for an option, a
phase or a tag arrives as a value, so pass it in as a `$`-prefixed prop and apply it as given —
`getConfigColor` from `@microteia/theme` resolves it against the theme when the option carries only a
name.

And §5 still has no exception, least of all here: no string a person reads is written in a view.

### Dates in a view

A view receives every date as a `Date`, by every road — `useCollection` in the office,
`usePortalRecords` and `usePortalRecord` in the portal. An instant (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, a
timestamp you wrote) is that instant; a `date` field is its day at noon UTC. Nothing arrives as a
Firestore Timestamp, and nothing arrives as text.

"Has it passed?", "what is due this week" and "most recent first" are questions about DAYS, so ask them
in days, with the two functions `@microteia/format` keeps for it:

```ts
import { dayOf, today } from '@microteia/format';

const upcoming = records.filter((r) => dayOf(r.deliveryDate) >= today());
```

`today()` is the organization's day — the same answer as `today()` in an expression, on the same time
zone, in the office and in the portal. `dayOf(v)` is the day of a value on that clock, as
`YYYY-MM-DD`, and `YYYY-MM-DD` sorts in calendar order. Do not compare a date as text (a `Date` turned
into a string does not sort), and do not write `new Date("2026-12-15")`: that is midnight UTC, which is
still the 14th everywhere in the Americas. `formatDate(v)` from the same module writes any of these
forms in the reader's locale.

## 8. Screens — the data your extension owns

### 8.0 Model before you declare

A screen is a VIEW of entities, never the shape of them. Decide the entities first, then let the
platform draw them.

| Storage | Cardinality | What you declare | What is stored |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reference` | many-to-one, one-to-one | field { type: 'reference', refEntity: <target collection>, multi: false } on the source screen | the target record id, as a string, in the source document |
| `child` | many-to-one | field { type: 'reference', refEntity: <parent collection> } on the source screen, PLUS parentEntity / parentFieldKey / parentRelation on that same screen | the parent record id in the child document; the platform turns the child list into a tab of the parent |
| `association` | many-to-many | field { type: 'reference', refEntity: <target collection>, multi: true } on the source screen | an array of target ids in the source document (at most 50 are materialised per read) |
| `lookup` | many-to-one | field { type: 'select', lookupCollection: <list collection> }, plus the list itself in `lookups` | the option KEY, as a string, in the source document |

A relationship is declared from the side that STORES the link, so `sourceField` belongs to
`sourceEntity`. The one exception is `one-to-many`, written from the "one" side because that is how
the business sentence arrives ("a sale has many items"); it is inverted before anything reads it.

Two things the platform does NOT have, and no declaration will fake:

- **No cascade and no referential restriction between business entities.** Deleting a record removes
  its own notes and documents, and nothing else. Children are left pointing at an id that no longer
  resolves. When they really must go, that is a workflow on `<collection>.deleted` with a `query` step
  and a `remove` step — declarable today, and it is what `validate_domain_model` will tell you.
- **No nested object field, and no dotted field key.** An embedded value object is stored flat, with
  the object's name as a prefix and a `section` grouping the leaves in the form (strategy
  `flatten-with-section`). That keeps them reachable from `compute`, `validate` and the list filter,
  which a separate 1:1 child screen would not.

**Duplication is allowed; silent duplication is not.** The rule is not "never duplicate data" — it is
that data which is a source of truth stays normalized *unless there is an explicit semantic reason* to
materialise or snapshot it. A line item's unit price is a correct snapshot: the price charged that day
must not change when the catalogue does. Two ways to say it, and they mean different things:

| | Follows the origin | Declared as |
|---|---|---|
| **Snapshot** | no — frozen on purpose | `{ semanticType: 'snapshot', source: 'Product.price', reason: '...' }` in the model |
| **Denormalization** | yes | `denormalize: { denormKey, fields, reason }` on the relationship, which becomes the reference field's `refDenormKey`: `<denormKey>.<field>` reads the target's current value, and nothing is copied into the record |

Undeclared, either one is indistinguishable from an accident.

**And the one limit worth knowing before you draw a diagram:** an aggregation cannot walk a `multi`
reference. The engine reads the parent id out of the child's reference field as a single value and
queries children by one equality, so an array never matches — a total over a many-to-many is not slow,
it is impossible. A many-to-many that carries attributes of its own (quantity, price, discount) is a
junction ENTITY, declared `kind: 'child'`, never an array of ids.

### 8.0.1 Model what HAPPENS, in the same breath

The structure is half of what arrived. "A sale is born as a draft; confirming it reserves stock and freezes its
items; invoicing it creates the financial entry; only the manager cancels an invoiced sale" describes four
entities and four transitions in one sentence, and nobody will come back later to ask for "the automation" —
they already asked. So the model has a `behavior` block, and it goes through the same gate.

    behavior: { states, transitions, invariants }

**A state is a key, never a label: the label is what the office renamed this morning.** A state machine is a `select` served by a list, and the option keys are what the
package SEEDS on install (once — from then on the options are the office's data, which is exactly why a
renamed label must never break a transition). Every `from` and `to` names a key. `initial` says where a record
is born; `terminal` says where it ends, because "this is the end" and "I forgot the way out" are written the
same way.

| declares | concern | mechanism | written as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `entity-event` | trigger | a workflow listening to the collection's own event (`<eventPrefix ?? collection>.saved`) | workflows: [{ eventName: '<collection>.saved', condition, steps }] |
| `user-action` | trigger | a callable workflow (`workflow.called`) plus the record action that invokes it | workflows: [{ eventName: 'workflow.called', parameters: [{ key: 'recordId', type: 'EntityReference', entityType: <collection> }], steps: [..., <the answer map>] }] PLUS actions: [{ key, workflowId: <that templateId> }], and the action is listed in the target screen's cardActionIds / viewActionIds. The button sends its record as `recordId` on every run, and reads result / status / actions from the last step |
| `schedule` | trigger | the kernel clock (`schedule`): it wakes the workflow at the cron time, in the office time zone, with no record and no actor — the workflow queries the records in the `from` state and loops over them | workflows: [{ eventName: 'schedule', schedule: { cron: <when> }, steps: [query, Loop] }] |
| `date-reached` | trigger | the kernel clock, by record (`<eventPrefix ?? collection>.dateReached`): once per record and per date value, at `at` in the office time zone, the record as the payload — a changed date fires again | workflows: [{ eventName: '<collection>.dateReached', dateReached: { field, offset, at }, condition, steps }] |
| `guard.expression` | guard | the condition node, or the workflow-level condition evaluated BEFORE any step | a step { type: 'Condition', condition, branches: { whenTrue, whenFalse } }, or the definition's own `condition` when the whole flow depends on it. NEVER a 'script' step: a script is code to review, and a condition is a declaration to read |
| `set-field / create-record / update-record` | effect | the data step that writes a record | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'upsert' } with an UpsertStepConfig |
| `delete-record` | effect | the data step that removes a record | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'remove' } with a RemoveStepConfig |
| `total` | effect | NO STEP. The field declares the aggregate and the kernel recomputes it on every child write | field { aggregation: { from, via, op, field } } on the parent — never logic.compute, which sees no child at all and returns zero forever |
| `notify` | effect | the notification step | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'notify' } |
| `call-automation` | effect | the step that calls another workflow | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'call-workflow', configuration: { targetWorkflowId } } |
| `wait` | effect | the wait step: the run pauses there and continues later, in the same run, with the effects after it. Only on a save or a date trigger — a button cannot wait, and a schedule runs its effects inside a loop. The effects after it see the record as it was at the passage: the wait does not re-check the state | a top-level step { stepDefinitionId: 'delay', configuration: { duration } }, in the position of the effect; a guard moves into the workflow condition so the wait stays at the top level |
| `generate-document` | effect | the step that fills a document template with the record of the transition and attaches the PDF or Word file to its Documents tab. The template names the screen, so the record is always the one of the entity of the transition — never on a delete, when there is no record left to attach to | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'render-document', configuration: { templateKey, recordId, output? } }, with the template declared through documentTemplateContribution on the same screen |
| `scope 'field'` | invariant | the field's own rule — evaluated as the person types AND on the write path, which throws | field { logic: { validate: 'if(<expression>, null, "<message>")' } } — the expression RETURNS the error message, and null (or an empty text, or false) accepts the value. This is the only invariant the platform enforces before the document exists, and it is why a blocking rule is written as a field rule |
| `scope 'record'` | invariant | the step that validates a whole object against the entity schema — INSIDE a flow, so after the write that started it | a step { stepDefinitionId: 'validate-object' } with a ValidateStepConfig, plus an 'exit' on the branch that refuses. It reports the record that is already wrong; it does not undo the write. The write path itself carries FIELD rules only |
| `scope 'transition', enforcement 'blocks'` | invariant | the write path: the field's own rule, and the record action that refuses the gesture | field { logic: { validate: 'if(<expression>, null, "<message>")' } } — which the repository THROWS on, before the document is written — plus, on a user-action transition, the action's disabledWhen / hiddenWhen over `record.<field>` and the flow's own condition, which is evaluated before the flow's upsert |
| `scope 'transition', enforcement 'reacts'` | invariant | the workflow condition plus the step that stops the flow. The record is ALREADY written | the definition's `condition`, plus a step { stepDefinitionId: 'exit' } on the branch that refuses. On `<collection>.saved` the document was committed before the event existed — the publisher is an onDocumentWritten trigger — and nothing rolls it back: what this stops is the rest of the flow |
| `scope 'collection'` | invariant | a declared KEY on the entity. The value is reserved in a document whose id derives from the value itself, written in the same batch as the record — and creating that document is the lock, so two writes at the same instant do not both pass | screen { keys: [{ name, kind: 'unique' | 'primary', fields, scope, normalize, sparse }] }, or `unique: true` on the field when one field is the whole key. NEVER an expression: a validate sees ONE record and cannot query the others, and a workflow on `<collection>.saved` finds the duplicate after it exists |
| `transition.permission` | permission | a declared capability, asked inside the declaration itself | contributes: [accessPermissionContribution({ id: 'resource.action', name })], asked with hasPermission("resource.action") in the action's hiddenWhen / disabledWhen and in the step condition. Every collection already yields <collection>.read|create|update|delete for free |

Read the refusals as answers, not as gaps to route around:

- **A clock moves records on; it never stops them.** `trigger: { kind: 'schedule', when: '0 5 * * *' }` becomes a
  workflow the kernel clock wakes at that cron time, in the office time zone, with no record and no actor. The
  `from` turns into the filter of a `query`, and the passage runs per record inside a `Loop`. What it cannot do
  is refuse a write — by the time it looks, the record is saved. And a schedule is often the wrong answer: a rule
  asked when something is WRITTEN, or a filtered list a person opens, needs no clock at all.
- **"When the date comes" is not a schedule.** "Overdue three days after the due date" is
  `trigger: { kind: 'date-reached', field: 'dueDate', offset: '+3d' }`, and it becomes a
  `<collection>.dateReached` workflow: the kernel finds the records that are due, each one arrives as the
  event, once per record and per date, and a changed date fires again. Reach for `schedule` only when the
  rule really is about the clock ("every Monday, close the week"), not about a date of the record.
- **Waiting is an effect, in order.** `effects: [create-record, { kind: 'wait', duration: '2d' }, notify]` runs the
  first effect at the passage and the last one two days later, in the same run. It is accepted on a save or a
  date trigger, and refused on a button (it waits for the answer) and on a schedule (its effects run inside a
  loop). The effects after the wait see the record AS IT WAS at the passage: "two days later, if it is still
  open, charge" is not a wait — it is `date-reached` on the date, with the state in the condition.
- **Generating a document is an effect.** `{ kind: 'generate-document', template: 'proposal', output: 'pdf' }`
  fills the template with the record of the transition and attaches the file to its Documents tab — the
  `render-document` step. The template is declared with `documentTemplateContribution` on the screen of that
  same entity, so the effect never names another entity (the model could not say WHICH record), and it is
  refused on a delete, when there is no record left to attach to. `output` is `pdf` (default) or `docx`.
- **Uniqueness is DECLARED, never computed.** It is the one rule that compares a record against the others, and
  the one you must not write as an expression: a field `validate` and a `validate-object` step both see a single
  record and never query, and a workflow on `<collection>.saved` finds the duplicate only after it exists — two
  writes at the same instant both pass. Declare it on the screen instead: `keys: [{ name, kind, fields }]`, or
  `unique: true` on the field when one field is the whole key. See "Keys — what cannot repeat" below.
- **A guard reads ONE record.** It never queries. When the condition needs other records, the `query` step
  publishes them and the condition node reads its outputs. That is the shape, and it costs one more step.
- **A permission is only answerable when a person acts.** With no actor — an automation born from a save —
  `hasPermission` answers `false`, always, because granting on the absence of a person would turn "nobody
  triggered this" into "can do anything". A permission on an event trigger is a flow that never runs.
- **A total is not a step.** Declare the field as derived from children with the aggregate and the kernel
  recomputes it on every write to a child, whoever caused it — including edits made outside your flow. The same
  goes for "the value of the most recent child" (the outcome of the last decision, the date of the last contact):
  that is `op: 'latest'` with an `orderBy`, not a pair of flows on `.saved` and `.deleted` querying with
  `limit: 1` — those miss a write made outside the flow and leave the field editable by hand.
- **A new aggregate reaches the records that already exist.** Adding an aggregate to a screen that already has
  records — or changing its `from`, `via`, `op`, `field`, `filter` or `orderBy` — fills in every existing
  parent on the server, in batches, without you writing a migration and without touching the children. It is
  the declaration that starts it, whoever wrote it: your package on install or update, the office in the Form
  Design. Only the aggregate that is new or changed is recomputed; the ones that were already right are left
  alone, and changing a label recomputes nothing. These writes are not business events: they publish no
  `<collection>.saved` and leave no audit line per record (one line for the whole pass), so a flow on `.saved`
  never runs over the office's history. They keep `updatedAt` as it was and stamp `updatedBy: 'aggregate-engine'`
  and `updatedVia: 'aggregate-backfill'`. A parent with more than 500 children is filled
  in with what was read and counted on the screen's notice, exactly as the live engine does. This needs kernel
  2.28.0 or later; on an earlier kernel the aggregate still works, but only on the
  parents whose children change after it was declared — a `kernel` range that admits an earlier one will
  install, and the old records will stay empty there.
- **An invariant that must REFUSE the passage cannot live in the automation.** The event of a save is published by
  an `onDocumentWritten` trigger: by the time it exists the document is committed, and the `exit` step halts the
  flow, not the write. So `scope: 'transition'` also declares `enforcement`. `blocks` belongs on the write path —
  a field rule, which the repository throws on before the document is written, plus, on a `user-action`, the
  action's `disabledWhen` over `record.<field>`, which refuses the gesture before anything runs. `reacts` is the
  condition plus `exit`, and its message has to read like one: "cannot" and "should not have" are not the same
  sentence to whoever receives it.

**And the `from` is checked, not decorated — but not in the same place on every trigger.** On `<collection>.saved`
the payload carries the CURRENT value at the root, the previous one under `old` (absent on an insert) and
`changeType: 'created' | 'updated'`, so `from` compares against the state the record is in and creation is
distinguishable from update. On `<collection>.deleted` the payload is the before-image — the field reads the state
it was in — and there is no `old` and no `changeType`; a passage triggered by a delete also writes nothing, because
the document is gone. And `workflow.called` carries NONE of the three: its context is the parameters you declared.
The state field only reaches it through an `EntityReference` parameter, which the hydrator resolves for you — the
plan names the parameter it needs. What stops the person before that is the action's own `disabledWhen`.

And the loop that has no mechanism to save you: an effect that writes back into the record that triggered it
republishes the event. It stops when the flow's condition stops matching — which is what moving the state does
for you — or when the second pass writes the same value, because the platform does not publish when the
document did not change. That is the same property that makes recomputing an aggregate safe. If neither holds,
the cascade is real, and it shows up as cost rather than as an error.

**And two things that are easy to leave empty and expensive to leave empty:**

- **Every `user-action` transition needs a `description`** — one business sentence about what the passage
  does. It becomes the flow's own description, and the "ai-detect-workflow" step lists callable flows and drops every one whose description is empty, so a flow with none is invisible to the only surface that picks a flow on its own. There is no symptom: it
  installs, it runs when somebody presses the button, and it is simply absent from the list that would have
  found it. The gate warns; nothing else ever would.
- **The notes, documents and tags tabs are OFF by default**, and turning one on is
  `entity.tabs: [{ kind, because }]`. The `because` is required, for the reason a snapshot's `reason` is:
  without it, "on purpose" and "out of habit" read exactly the same six months later.

**Two things the gate cannot decide, and they are yours:**

- **Which states the business actually has.** The sentence names one or two; the rest come from the rest of the
  conversation, and a state nobody mentioned may still be required for the thing to work. No comparison
  derives that. What the gate does check is that what you declared is coherent — that every state is reachable,
  that every one has a way out or is declared final, and that no `from`/`to` names a label.
- **Whether an actor named in the rule is a NEW permission or one that already exists.** "Only the manager
  cancels" might be `sales.cancel`, which nothing offers yet and the package must declare, or `sales.update`,
  which every collection yields for free. Choosing is a judgement about what the office means by the word.
  What the gate checks is that naming an actor and asking nothing of them is a defect, and it tells you when
  the identifier is neither derived from a collection nor one the kernel declares.

### 8.0.2 The plan decides the SCREEN too, by rule

`generate_artifact_plan` does not only say which collections must exist. It says what the screen IS — and
those decisions are rules, not taste. Before this, the vacuum was filled session by session, with a different
answer each time: a screen with no `titleFieldKey` lists records that all read the same, a child with a menu
entry gives two doors to the same data, and a user-action transition with no record action is an automation
nobody can trigger.

| what arrives | what is decided, with no exception | declared as |
|---|---|---|
| entity of kind "entity" | a list and a detail, reachable from the menu | one `screens: [{ key, titleFieldKey, fields }]` entry; the platform draws list, detail, form and filters |
| entity of kind "child" | a tab of its parent, and NEVER an entry of its own in the menu | `parentEntity` / `parentFieldKey` / `parentRelation` on the screen, plus `hideFromSidebar: true` |
| entity of kind "lookup" | an option list in the collection, and NEVER a screen | `lookups: [{ collection, label }]` — no screen, no records, no four permissions |
| entity of kind "valueObject" | a section of the owner's form; it is not a screen and not a collection | the flattened keys carry `section: <the field label>` on the owner screen |
| relationship many-to-one (and one-to-one) | a reference field on the N side; the label of the pointed record is resolved when it is drawn | field { type: 'reference', refEntity } — never a second field holding the other record's name |
| relationship one-to-many that is not a child | nothing. No tab of related records unless the rule asks for one | no artifact. A related-records tab is `storage: "child"` with `ownership: "association"` |
| derived field (computed or aggregated) | read-only in the form | nothing to declare — the form disables any field carrying `logic.compute` or `aggregation` |
| state field | a column of the list, and filterable | field { showInList: true, filterable: true } on the select served by the state list |
| transition triggered by user-action | one record action, disabled exactly where the blocking invariant says the passage is refused | actions: [{ key, workflowId, disabledWhen, hiddenWhen }], listed in the screen's cardActionIds / viewActionIds |
| entity key (entity.keys, or a field with unique: true) | one declared key on the screen — and NOTHING is inferred: an entity with no key declared gets none, because "these two records look alike" is a business statement, never a shape of the data | screen { keys: [{ name, kind, fields, scope, normalize, sparse }] }. The value is reserved in a document whose id derives from the value, in the same batch as the record — creating it is the lock. It is NOT the document id, which stays random so a corrected value does not have to move the document |
| relationship one-to-one WITHOUT a key on the reference field | a warning, not an artifact: stored, it is a many-to-one, and the "one" holds only if a key says so | nothing is emitted. Declaring `unique: true` on the reference field is what makes it one-to-one |
| notes, documents and tags tabs | off, unless the entity declares the tab WITH the reason | `hasNotes` / `hasDocuments` / `hasTags` (+ `tagCollection`), from `entity.tabs` |

The list columns are the title, the state field, every REQUIRED reference (a row with no customer has no
context) and anything you asked for with `showInList`. A total does not go to the list on its own: a total is
read in the detail, and putting every total in the list is a decision about the LIST. Filters are the state,
references, option lists and yes/no — free text stays out, because the platform already has search and a text
filter beside it is the same question in two places.

And what the plan does NOT decide, it hands back, named:

- the icon of each screen (`icon`) — it names the business to whoever looks at the menu, and no comparison derives it
- the position in the menu (`sidebarOrder`) — an order is a statement about what matters most here
- the subtitle and the image of the card (`subtitleFieldKey`, `imageFieldKey`) — which second field identifies a record is a judgement
- the title of each record action, and its icon — they are text a person reads, and they travel through the message catalog

Plus, per action, WHERE it appears. On the card of the list and in the header of the detail the same gesture
means different things, and only one half of that is derivable: a gesture disabled because of a field the card
does not show is a greyed-out button with no visible reason, so it belongs in the detail. When the refusal
reads only fields the card shows, both placements are legible and the choice is about how people work here —
the plan says so instead of picking.

**The `disabledWhen` of each action is not a suggestion.** It carries the transition's `from` plus every
invariant you declared with `enforcement: 'blocks'`, negated and joined. That is the only place a blocking
invariant can sit on a gesture, and writing the action without it gives a button that fires a flow whose
condition silently discards it.

### 8.1 Declaring one

A `screen` declares an entity: a collection, its fields, its title. The platform draws the list, the
detail, the form, the filters and the search. You write no UI for any of it.

```ts
screens: [{
  key: 'invoices',                       // referenced by other artifacts in THIS package
  sourceId: 'com.example.billing:invoice',   // universal identity — how an update recognises it
  titleSingular: label('screen.singular'),
  titlePlural: label('screen.plural'),
  icon: 'filePaper',
  titleFieldKey: 'number',
  subtitleFieldKey: 'client',
  fields: FIELDS,
  hasNotes: true, hasDocuments: true, hasTags: true, tagCollection: 'invoiceTags',
  listActions: ['copyLink', 'manageTags', 'delete'],   // the card shows them in this order
  sidebarOrder: 60,
}]
```

**A screen declares no opening filter.** Its list opens whole from wherever it is reached; a queue
that should open on "waiting" says so on the menu entry that leads to it — `nav({ screen, badge, filter
})`, §7 "The list the entry opens" — which is also where the badge counting the same slice lives. Mark
the fields that slice is cut by `filterable: true`: the filter takes no other key.

`key` is what your own artifacts use. `sourceId` is what *updates* use: it is universal, so the same
screen arriving from a new version — or from a second extension — is recognised instead of duplicated.

**You do not choose it, and you never change it.** `generate_artifact_plan` emits the `sourceId` of every
screen it plans, in this order:

1. the ledger first: a sourceId this rule already registered is used exactly as recorded, forever — a new derivation is never applied to a screen that already exists
1. then the package: whatever the plugin.ts (or the catalog of this installation) already declares for that collection
1. and only for a screen that is NEW, the derivation: "<extension id>:<collection>"

Copy it verbatim. A `sourceId` that changes between two versions of the same package fails nowhere: the
update finds no screen with that identity, claims the declared key, finds it taken and installs a SECOND
screen beside the first. The records stay in the old collection with no screen over them, in every
organization that had the earlier version, and nothing on screen says that is what happened.

### Fields

| Type | |
|---|---|
| `text` | One line of text. |
| `textarea` | Several lines of plain text. |
| `number` | A number. `rules.validate` can bound it. |
| `currency` | A number shown and typed as money, in the locale of whoever is looking. |
| `date` | A day. It is stored as that day at noon UTC, so the day that goes in is the day that comes out in every time zone; a view receives it as a `Date` (§7, "Dates in a view"). |
| `time` | A time of day, stored as `HH:mm`. |
| `checkbox` | True or false. |
| `select` | One option — or several with `multi: true`. The options come from `options` (yours, fixed) or from `lookupCollection` (a list the organization owns and edits). |
| `masked` | Text shaped by a named PRESET: `mask` carries the preset's key, never a template. Declare your own with `fieldRulePresetContribution` — its `templates` use `#` for a digit, `A` for a letter, `*` for either, and anything else literally (`###.###.###-##`); several templates in one preset alternate by length. A preset of another extension (`cpfCnpj` of the Brasil extension) needs that extension in `dependencies`; `check` refuses a key the kernel, your package and the dependencies it can read do not declare — an unknown key installs and the field silently goes without its mask. |
| `reference` | Points at a record of another screen. `refEntity` is the target — a `key` of a screen in your own package, or a collection that already exists. |
| `markdown` | Rich text, written and rendered as Markdown. |
| `file` | One upload. The value stored is the download URL, so the field stays scalar; `file` restricts extension and size. |

Beyond `key`, `label`, `type`, `order` and `required`, the properties that decide how a field behaves:

| | |
|---|---|
| `section` | groups fields under a heading in the form. A reference, like every label |
| `placeholder`, `mask` | what the empty field says; what it accepts |
| `options`, `optionsAllowUserAdd`, `optionsColored`, `multi` | a `select`'s choices — fixed by you, or extendable by the organization |
| `lookupCollection` | the `select` reads a list the organization owns. Declare the list in `lookups` |
| `refEntity`, `refDenormKey` | a `reference`'s target, and the name expressions navigate it by |
| `defaultValue` | what a new record is born with. Seeds only — the person can still change it |
| `autoValue: { pattern }` | a generated code: `A` letter, `0` digit, `*` either, anything else literal (`AA-0000`). Not repeated among the records already loaded, and still editable. For a code that must truly not repeat, declare a key — or a sequence |
| `autoValue: { pattern, sequence: { scope?, resetBy? } }` | a NUMBER the record receives when it is created, from a counter advanced in the same transaction that writes it: two records never get the same one, and the field is read-only from then on — the form shows it disabled, and an automation, a script, the agent or the portal that writes it is refused. In `pattern`, `YYYY` is the year (in the organization's time zone) and the one run of `0` is the number with leading zeros, as a minimum width (`'YYYY/000000'` → `2026/000123`); empty, the plain number. `scope`: `'tenant'` (default) or `'parent'` — one counter per parent record, which needs `parentFieldKey`. `resetBy`: `'never'` (default) or `'year'`, which demands `YYYY` in the pattern. Only a top-level `text` (the formatted number) or `number` (the integer, no pattern, no yearly reset) field. A number is never reused: deleting a record leaves its gap. Records created before the declaration keep no number. A package declaring it declares `kernel: '^2.76.0'` or later |
| `logic` | the expressions: `compute`, `validate`, `hiddenWhen`, `disabledWhen`, `onChange` (§9) |
| `logic.onChangeLookup: { provider, map }` | when the field changes, asks an external provider (`lookupProviderContribution` — the Brasil extension publishes `viacep`) and fills OTHER fields with the reply. `map` names, key by key, the field of THIS screen that receives each value — `{ street: 'addressStreet', city: 'addressCity' }` —, which is how a flattened value object (§8.0) gets filled; a provider key left out of `map` is discarded. The field that triggers the lookup is never rewritten, and `check` refuses a target that is not a field of the screen, or one the platform writes itself (`compute`, `derive`, `aggregation`). Without `map`, `targetPrefix` writes `<prefix>.<key>` — the dotted form §8.0 forbids, kept only for those who already use it; never declare both. Client only. A package using `map` declares `kernel: '^2.80.0'` or later |
| `aggregation: { from, via, op, field?, filter?, orderBy? }` | the value comes from CHILD records — `op` is one of `sum`, `count`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `latest`. Declared, not inferred, so the engine knows exactly when to recompute. `latest` copies `field` of the first child that passes `filter` after sorting by `orderBy` (required with it, and only with it): an empty key sorts last in both directions, ties fall to `createdAt` in the direction of the last key and then to the document id, and no matching child makes the field empty (`null`). The parent field must have the child field's type, option list, target and cardinality — the value is copied as it is. "The first" is `latest` with `dir: 'asc'`. A package using `latest` declares `kernel: '^2.23.0'` or later |
| `rules` | `validate` (`check`, `pattern`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `message`) and `format` (`preset`, or `pattern` + `replacement`). `check` and `format.preset` name a preset, held like `mask` (see `masked` above). A requirement that depends on other fields is an expression in `logic.validate` |
| `showInList`, `listLabel`, `listIcon`, `listOrder` | whether and how the field appears on the list card |
| `filterable` | the field becomes a filter on the list |
| `searchable` | the field's value becomes a search term of the record, kept by the server — besides the title, which always is, without declaring it. A `reference` contributes the title of the record it points to, and stays current when that record is renamed; a `select`, the option label. Search matches the start of each word, ignoring accents and case, and a punctuated number by its digits. Only on `text`, `textarea`, `masked`, `select`, `reference`: a date, a number or a checkbox is filtered (`filterable`), not searched, and `check` refuses it. Kernel `^2.95.0` |
| `hiddenInForm` | keeps a field out of the form without deleting it |
| `contact: 'email' \| 'phone'` | the field holds a way to reach someone. It is what lets `notify` write to its value (`recipientAddresses`, `recipientPhones`, §10) — nothing else does. Only on a one-value `text` or `masked` field. Kernel `^2.78.0` |
| `file: { extensions, maxSizeMb }` | what a `file` field accepts — the size is in megabytes |
| `optionsFilter: { where: [{ path, op, value }] }` | offers only the options that match what the form already holds — the breed by the pet type, the city by the state. On a `reference`, `path` is a field of the target screen; on a `select`, one of `key`, `label` (`label` answers in the reader's language, so prefer `key`). `op` is one of `eq`, `neq`, `in`, `contains`, `startsWith`. `value` is `{ field }` — a field of this screen, which may cross a reference (`client.city`) — or `{ literal }`. Conditions are ANDed. While a compared field is empty the list is empty, and changing it clears a choice it no longer offers, down the chain. A FORM rule only: a workflow, an import or the agent can still write any value. `check` refuses a path the option does not have and a compared field the screen does not have. Before kernel `2.104.0` every option is offered |

**Fields the organization adds** to your screen are theirs. An update of your extension preserves
them, and uninstalling removes only yours.

### The list card — `cardTemplate`

Leave it out and the list draws the standard card: avatar, title, subtitle, the `listIcon` rows, the
`showInList` fields, the tags and the actions. Declare it only when the screen needs a different card,
or a list of one card per line:

```ts
cardTemplate: {
  layout: 'list',                          // 'grid' (default) or 'list'
  minWidth: 'md',                          // grid column: 'sm' | 'md' (default) | 'lg'
  accent: { field: 'priority' },           // top stripe: the color of the chosen option of a select
  body: [
    { type: 'row', justify: 'between', children: [
      { type: 'row', children: [{ type: 'avatar', size: 'sm' }, { type: 'title' }] },
      { type: 'field', field: 'status', variant: 'badge' },
    ] },
    { type: 'field', field: 'dueDate', icon: 'calendar', label: true },
    { type: 'text', text: label('card.overdue'), tone: 'danger', hiddenWhen: 'dueDate >= today()' },
    { type: 'row', justify: 'between', children: [{ type: 'tags' }, { type: 'actions' }] },
  ],
}
```

| Node | Draws |
|---|---|
| `row`, `stack` | children side by side / one under the other (`gap`, `align`, `justify`, `wrap`) |
| `spacer`, `divider` | pushes the rest of a row to the end / a line |
| `avatar`, `title`, `subtitle` | the record's image (`imageFieldKey`) or the screen icon, `titleFieldKey`, `subtitleFieldKey` |
| `field` | one field, formatted by its type. `label: true` shows its list label; `variant`: `text`, `muted`, `strong` or `badge` (the chosen options as colored badges); an empty field takes no space unless `showEmpty` |
| `fields`, `metaRows` | the standard card's `showInList` block and `listIcon` rows, placed where you want them |
| `tags` | the record's tags, on a screen with tags |
| `actions` | the card actions — the same ones, same order, same rules. `placement: 'hover'` shows them on hover, top-right; `include`/`exclude` pick by the platform action key or your action's `key`/`sourceId` |
| `text`, `icon` | fixed text (`tone`, `size`) / an icon of the catalog |

Every node accepts `hiddenWhen`: the same expression, over the same scope, as an action's `hiddenWhen`.
Fixed text is a `label('…')` reference — never a sentence, which no catalog would translate. A value
composed of several fields is a `derive` field (§9) placed with `field`, not a template.

`check` refuses an unknown node, a field the screen does not have, an icon outside the catalog and an
expression that does not parse. A kernel older than 2.86.0 ignores the
declaration and draws the standard card, so no `kernel` range is required. The organization can redraw
the card in the Form Design ("Card" tab); an update of your extension that declares a card replaces
theirs, and one that declares none keeps it.

### Keys — what cannot repeat

A screen with no key accepts duplicates, and that is the default on purpose: two identical rows are
two valid rows until somebody says otherwise. When the business says otherwise, DECLARE it — it is
the one rule here you must not write as an expression.

```ts
screens: [{
  key: 'produtos',
  titleFieldKey: 'nome',
  keys: [
    { name: 'sku', kind: 'primary', fields: ['sku'], sparse: false },
    { name: 'linha-nome', kind: 'unique', fields: ['linha', 'nome'] },
    { name: 'email', kind: 'unique', fields: ['email'], normalize: { caseInsensitive: true } },
  ],
  fields: [ /* … */ ],
  // …the rest of the screen, as above
}]
```

A key over ONE field can be written on the field itself — `unique: true` — which produces exactly
the same key, named `field:<key>`. Reach for `keys` when the COMBINATION of several fields is what
must not repeat, or when you need a scope, a comparison, or a value that is required.

| | |
|---|---|
| `name` | stable, and it is what finds the reservation already written for existing records. Renaming a key retires it and declares another |
| `kind: 'unique'` | forbids a second record with this value |
| `kind: 'primary'` | that, plus the key is an ADDRESS: a write with no `id` can find the record by it, and repeating it changes the record instead of being refused (see "A primary key as an address" below). At most one per screen, and never optional |
| `fields` | keys of fields of THIS screen, in order — and the order is part of the value |
| `scope: 'tenant' \| 'parent'` | `tenant` (default) is the whole organization; `parent` is unique WITHIN one parent record — the item numbered 1 of EACH order — and it needs `parentFieldKey` |
| `normalize` | how two values count as the same: `trim` (on by default), `caseInsensitive`, and `formatPreset` — `digits` makes `123.456` and `123456` one value |
| `sparse` | on by default: a record with no value reserves nothing, so forty records with an empty field do not collide in the void. `false` makes the value required |
| `message` | the reference of what the person reads on the conflict |

**How it holds.** The value is written into a reservation document whose id derives from the value
itself, in the SAME batch as the record. Creating that document is the lock: the security rules
allow `create` and not `update`, and `create` only fires when the document does not exist — so a
second write with the same value fails the batch WHOLE, and no duplicate is ever committed. There is
no window between checking and writing, and it needs no composite index.

**What a key is not.** It is not the document id. The id stays random, because a natural key changes
— the CPF was typed wrong — and moving a document would break every reference pointing at it. A key
is an index: references keep pointing at the id.

**A primary key as an address.** A `primary` key lets a write that carries no `id` FIND the record:
the one holding the same key value is updated, and when none does, a record is created. The value is
compared after the field's own formatting, as the reservation stored it. This is opt-in per write,
never a default — without it, the second write with the same value is refused as a duplicate, which
is how every write behaved before:

| Write | Addresses by the `primary` key |
|---|---|
| bulk import (§8) | always — re-running the same file changes what the first run created |
| the `upsert` step | with `matchPrimaryKey: true` in its `UpsertStepConfig` |
| a script's `upsert()` | with `matchPrimaryKey: true` beside `table` and `data` |
| the form, `create_record` over MCP, a portal guest | never: each one says CREATE, and a taken value is refused |

An `id` in the write still wins, and a collection with no `primary` key writes as it always did. Reach
for it when an automation must be safe to run twice — a batch generated again, an event delivered
twice — instead of querying by the key's fields before each write. A package whose workflow uses
`matchPrimaryKey` declares `kernel: '^2.82.0'` or later, and `check`
refuses one that admits an earlier kernel, where the option is ignored and the second run fails.

**On a collection that already has records**, you write nothing beyond the declaration. A key that
is new — or whose `fields`, `normalize`, `scope` or `sparse` changed, or whose `formatPreset`
now formats differently — is ADOPTED by the platform, whoever declared it: your package on install or
update, the office in the Form Design. Do not write a migration for it.

- From the first instant, a value written by the form or by an `upsert` is checked against the key:
  a new record, or a record whose key value changes, is refused if the value is taken.
- Editing any other field of a record that already existed never trips over the key. Its value is
  the sweep's business, not the next save's.
- The sweep runs on the server, in batches, and only writes the reservations and the record's
  `keyRefs`. No other field, and not `updatedAt`. These writes are not business events: no
  `<collection>.saved`, no audit line per record.
- When nothing is duplicated, the key starts holding on every record by itself. Until then it is
  **pending**.
- When old records repeat a value — or lack it, on a `primary` or `sparse: false` key — the key
  stays pending. Whoever manages screens sees the repeated values on the screen's list, and the
  office's audit log gets one line. Correcting or deleting the records is the whole gesture: each
  such write rechecks the list, and the key starts holding as soon as nothing repeats.
- A `formatPreset` that is not installed holds the sweep until it is.

`status` on a key is ignored: whether a key holds is the platform's to say, not the declaration's.
This needs kernel 2.29.0 or later. On an earlier kernel the key holds from
the moment it is declared without looking at what is stored: an old duplicate is never reported, and
saving that record is refused for a reason nobody showed.

**Where the line is.** The reservation is what makes a duplicate impossible through every honest
path: the form, an automation's `upsert`, an import, a migration. What the security rules cannot
check generically is that the value reserved IS the value stored — the rules are static and keys are
runtime data, so a rule cannot compute an id from a list of fields it does not know. That last inch
is enforced at the two write paths, which is the same footing `required`, a mask and
`rules.validate` already stand on.

### Edit window — what cannot change after the fact

Some records are EVIDENCE of what was said or done: a message to a client, a timesheet entry, a ledger
line. Once somebody has read one, changing its text changes the evidence. Declare how long it stays
editable:

```ts
{ key: 'messages', /* ... */ editWindow: { minutes: 15, delete: true } }
```

Counted from `createdAt`, which the platform stamps with the server's clock. After the window:

- the form locks its fields and the gesture to delete (with `delete: true`), and says until when it
  was open — while it is open, it says until when it will be;
- every write path refuses: an automation's `upsert`, a script, the AI agent (`update_record`,
  `delete_record`, and `describe_screen` reports the window), a portal guest;
- the security rules refuse whoever writes to the database directly. That is what makes it a guarantee,
  and not a suggestion the form makes.

| | |
|---|---|
| `minutes` | a whole number greater than zero. Anything else is refused by `check` — and, if it ever reaches the database, the security rules treat it as a window that is already closed |
| `delete` | `true` freezes deleting too. Absent, deleting follows the collection's permission only — which also means a record can be deleted and created again, which the audit log shows as exactly that |

**The record's documents are part of the evidence.** On a screen with `hasDocuments`, once the
record's window has closed nothing deletes, replaces or renames a document of that record — not a
member, not the owner, not an automation, a script, the AI agent or a portal guest — and that holds
whether or not `delete` is `true`: removing one attachment and adding another would change the
evidence while the record kept its date. Attaching a NEW document is still allowed. The window is the
record's (counted from the record's `createdAt`), not each file's. The security rules of both the
database and the file storage enforce it; a document's name, type and file never change at all, inside
the window or after it — what fits inside the window is deleting it. The one way out is deleting the
record itself, when the screen allows that: the record goes first, and its documents follow. From
kernel `2.72.0`; an older kernel freezes the record but not its
documents.

**Every attached file carries a SHA-256.** The server computes it from the stored bytes and writes it as
`sha256` (hex) on the document — a system field nobody writes from outside and the server never
rewrites. It shows in the Documents tab, in the portal (`usePortalDocuments` returns it), in
`list_documents` for the AI agent, and in the `<prefix>_document.saved` event, so a workflow and
its expressions can read `sha256` the moment the file is attached. A file uploaded from the browser
gets it a moment after the upload; until then the field is absent.

What still passes after the window: creating (never barred), the fields any member may write
(`memberWritableFields` — mark as read, like), and the platform's own bookkeeping, which is not a
business write (recounting an aggregate, adopting a key). A workflow that stamps the record right after
it is created fits inside the window. `createdAt` itself never changes, not even inside it.

**Nobody overrides it at run time — not even the owner of the organization.** The only way to reopen a
window is to change the declaration, which takes `screens.edit-window` (in the Form Design) or
`extensions.manage` — somebody who only designs screens cannot — and lands in the audit log. A record
that needs correcting after the window gets a new record that corrects it, the way a ledger does.

**The organization can set a window too**, in the Form Design ("Edit window" tab), on its own screens
and on yours. On an update of your extension, what your package declares wins; what it does NOT declare
removes nothing — a version that drops its window leaves the one that was in force, because removing a
lock on evidence is a person's decision, not a side effect of updating.

A record without a readable `createdAt` is closed, not open forever. Requires
`kernel: "^2.68.0"`: an older kernel ignores the declaration and the records would
stay editable forever, so `check` refuses the package instead.

### Record visibility — who reads EACH record

A collection's permission answers per COLLECTION: whoever has `<collection>.read` reads every record
in it. Some records belong to whoever they are assigned to — a confidential reply only its issuer reads,
a support ticket, a patient's chart. Declare which member-reference fields name the people who read a
record:

```ts
{
  key: 'replies',
  fields: [
    { key: 'issuer', type: 'reference', refEntity: 'members', /* ... */ },
    { key: 'team', type: 'reference', refEntity: 'members', multi: true, /* ... */ },
  ],
  memberVisibility: { userFields: ['issuer', 'team'] },
}
```

A member then reads a record only when their id is in one of those fields — the value of a single
reference, or an item of a `multi` one — or when they SUPERVISE:

| | |
|---|---|
| `userFields` | 1 to 4 fields of THIS screen, each a reference to `members`. The security rules have no loops and read 4 positions, so `check` refuses more — and refuses a field that is not a member reference: a person's name in a text field never matches an id |
| `bypassPermission` | who reads them all. Absent, the platform derives `<collection>.read-all` ("View all records"), which requires `<collection>.read` and shows up in the organization's access profiles by itself. Name one of your own permissions instead (declared with `accessPermissionContribution`, §13) when supervising means something in your domain |

The owner of the organization and the system administrators read every record, as they pass every
permission.

**Every path honors it**, not only the list:

- the security rules refuse to read, change or delete a record that does not name the member, and its
  notes, documents and files with it. Creating is never barred — a record may be born naming somebody
  else, which is how one is forwarded. Changing a record so it names somebody else is allowed too, and
  from then on the one who forwarded it no longer reads it;
- the platform adds the filter to every list, picker, tab and search of the collection by itself —
  `useEntityList` in your views included —, and a link to a record the member cannot read opens as a
  record that does not exist;
- the AI agent (`search_records`, `get_record`, `run_report`, `list_documents`, documents, and
  `update_record`/`delete_record`, which treat a hidden record as missing) reads as the person who owns
  the token, within the token's ceiling — and `describe_screen` says the screen is restricted and whether
  this token sees all;
- a report counts only what the person running it can read, and a field reached through a reference to a
  hidden record comes back empty;
- a document generated by a person lists only the child records that person reads.

**Workflows read as the organization.** A step "Search records", a script's `query()` and an action's
workflow see the whole collection, whoever pressed the button: numbering a protocol, counting what is
open or finding the record to forward needs every record, and the same workflow must not write different
data depending on who triggered it. What a workflow does with what it read — writing it somewhere
visible, notifying someone — is your decision as its author, the same way it already is for collection
permissions.

What it does NOT hide: an **aggregate** stored on a parent (`aggregation`) is computed over every
child, so a count of restricted children shows on a parent everyone reads — do not aggregate a secret.
The same goes for a **name read through a reference** (`<denormKey>.<field>`) and shown on another record. And the
workflow execution history keeps what each step returned.

On an update of your extension, what your package declares wins; what it does NOT declare removes
nothing — dropping the restriction is a person's decision, with `screens.member-visibility` in the
Form Design, never a side effect of updating. The organization can also turn it on for its own screens
and yours there ("Record visibility" tab).

Requires `kernel: "^2.75.0"`: an older kernel ignores the declaration, and
every member who reads the collection would read every record, so `check` refuses the package instead.

### Relationships, and where a screen shows up

| | |
|---|---|
| `parentEntity`, `parentFieldKey` | this screen is a CHILD: which screen, and the `reference` field that points at it. On an `owned` child the form hides that field only when it is opened from INSIDE the parent (the child tab, a list locked with `useEntityList({ parent })`), where it comes filled in; opened from the child's own screen, the field shows as declared, so a child with a menu of its own can still be created there |
| `parentRelation: 'owned' \| 'related'` | `owned` — it exists because of the parent; deleting the parent does NOT delete it (there is no cascade, see above), it is left orphaned. `related` — it merely points at the parent, and the gesture that fits is unlinking. A `required` link is treated as `owned` for the card gestures whatever this says: Unlink would empty a field the save refuses |
| `hideFromParentTabs` | the child does not become a tab of the parent |
| `hideFromSidebar`, `sidebarOrder` | whether a top-level screen gets its own menu entry, and where. Hide it when you declare the entry yourself with `nav({ screen: '<screen key>', badge })` — that is how a menu entry gets a badge, and a `filter` that opens the list on the slice the badge counts. Write `screen`, never `key`: a screen's key is not a tab key, and `nav({ key: '<screen key>' })` is refused (§4, "Where a menu entry leads"). A `nav({ screen })` over a screen that does NOT hide itself replaces its automatic entry instead of adding a second one |
| `hideRecordsFromCommandPalette` | the records of this screen stay out of the command palette (⌘K) search. Declare it when a machine fills the collection — an ingestion, a mail feed — or its records crowd out what people are looking for. The screen itself is still offered ("Open …"), so a screen that also hides from the sidebar keeps one way in; lists, links, tabs and reference pickers are untouched |
| `recordTabPrefix` | opening a record from outside (audit log, a mention, the command palette) lands on YOUR view instead of the form (§7) |
| `dataCollection` | install the screen over a collection that already exists, instead of creating one. `fields` is still the complete schema of it |
| `eventPrefix` | the prefix of the events this collection emits, which is what workflows subscribe to (§10) |
| `listActions`, `viewActionIds`, `cardActionIds` | the platform's own record gestures by key; your `actions` by `templateId` |
| `memberWritableFields` | fields ANY member may write on a record someone else created — the door for per-person state (read, liked, saved) that the default permission would close |
| `authorCanDelete` | whoever created the record deletes it, without an administrator |
| `editWindow` | how long after creation the record may still be changed — and, with `delete: true`, deleted. Its documents freeze with it. Enforced by the security rules, not only the form; see "Edit window" above |
| `memberVisibility` | which members read EACH record: the ones it names in a member reference (`userFields`), plus whoever has `bypassPermission` — or the derived `<collection>.read-all`. Enforced by the security rules and every server path that hands a record to a person; see "Record visibility" above |
| `portal` | what an outside guest sees: `subject` (`'self'` for the screen whose records receive guests, `{ field }` for a reference that leads to it, `'parent'` to inherit from the parent, `'public'` for records every guest of the organization reads, read-only — section 4; requires `kernel: "^2.94.0"`), the `fields` that leave the organization — nothing else does — and `documents` to expose the documents someone marked as shared. `visibleWhen` is a field expression on the WHOLE record that decides which records leave (`type == "revenue"`) — false or invalid, the record is not in the portal, and neither is anything that reaches the guest through it; requires `kernel: "^2.61.0"`. `create: { fields, when? }` lets the guest create records, filling only those fields — the link to the subject is set by the server from what the guest already sees, never from what they send; it is refused on the `'self'` screen. `when` is a field expression on the record the new one belongs to plus `actor` (`"partner" in actor.portalRoles`) — only guests for whom it holds create (section 4); requires `kernel: "^2.89.0"`. A `reference` there (or in `edit.fields`) whose target screen is in the portal is chosen among the records the guest sees, and the server refuses any other id (section 4). A field the guest does not send starts with its `defaultValue`, as in the organization's form — which is why a required field with a default may stay out of `create.fields`. A derived field (`logic.derive`) is computed when read and never stored, so it cannot be in `fields` nor in `create.fields`: the guest would always see it empty, and the package is refused. `uploads: { types }` lets the guest ATTACH documents — choosing one of those types (none listed = any the organization has), never creating one, and never deleting; it requires `documents`. `edit: { fields, when?, onlyOwn? }` lets the guest CHANGE records: only those fields, and only fields that are also in `fields` (a guest never overwrites what they cannot see); never the link to the subject; `when` is a field expression on the WHOLE record (`status == "draft"`) checked by the server on every change — invalid means closed —, and `onlyOwn` limits it to records the guest created in the portal. `invites: { automation: true }`, on the `'self'` screen only, lets workflows invite guests to its records with `portal-invite` (section 10). `documentLinks: { expiresInMinutes }` hands guests short-lived signed document links instead of the permanent one (section 4); requires `kernel: "^2.77.0"`. `trackViews: true` has the server record every time a guest opens a record or gets a document link — an Audit trail entry and `<collection>.portalViewed` (sections 4 and 10); requires `kernel: "^2.79.0"`. `actions: [key]` offers the record's own actions (`viewActionIds`, by `key`) as buttons on the guest's open record — conditions checked by the server on the whole record with `surface == "portal"`, the workflow run as the guest, only its `status` returned (section 4); requires `kernel: "^2.81.0"`. `referenceTitles: [field]` lets an exposed `reference` carry the title of the record it points to even when that record's screen is not in the portal — only the title leaves, and it follows the target (section 4); requires `kernel: "^2.84.0"`. `template: { card?, detail? }` draws the portal's list card and open record from nodes — emphasis, sections, fixed text — using only exposed fields; it arranges, never exposes (section 4) |
| `auditActions` | which actions are audited. Absent = all. Declare it when a machine writes the collection, or the audit log drowns in one entry per ingested document |
| `seed` | records the extension delivers ready to use — a catalog with attributes of its own. See "Preloaded records" below |

### Option lists

`lookups` declare a list the organization owns, with optional *seed* options:

```ts
lookups: [{ collection: 'invoiceStatuses', label: label('lookup.statuses'), options: [
  { key: 'OPEN', label: label('status.open') },
  { key: 'PAID', label: label('status.paid') },
] }]
```

How seeds are written is `seed`:

| `seed` | Empty list | List that already has options |
|---|---|---|
| `'when-empty'` (default) | all of them | nothing |
| `'required'` | all of them | the ones missing — by key or by label — that THIS extension has not delivered before |

After that the options are the organization's: it renames and removes them, and `'required'` never
brings back a key it already delivered. Use it when your screens or templates depend on the options.
A list of the platform (`documentTypes`) has no options of its own — the platform ships none — and
an extension adds its vocabulary there the same way, without declaring the list:

```ts
lookups: [{ collection: 'documentTypes', label: label('lookup.document-types'), seed: 'required', options: [
  { key: 'Invoice', label: 'Invoice' },
] }]
```

`seed: 'required'` and seeding a platform list require kernel `^2.71.0`. Keep the
option `key` stable — it is what every record already stores. `tagLists` declares tag collections the same
way, without seeds.

### Preloaded records

When a catalog has attributes of its own — a breed with a species, a product with a price, a service
type with a duration — it is a screen, not an option list, and the screen can ship its starting records
with `seed`. The rules are the ones of option lists:

```ts
screens: [{
  key: 'petshopBreeds',
  // ...
  seed: {
    mode: 'required',
    records: [
      { key: 'labrador-retriever', data: { name: 'Labrador Retriever', species: 'dog' } },
      { key: 'persian', data: { name: '@com.acme.petshop/breed.persian', species: 'cat' } },
    ],
  },
}]
```

| `mode` | What is delivered |
|---|---|
| `'when-empty'` (default) | all of them, if the collection is empty the first time your extension seeds it; otherwise nothing, ever |
| `'required'` | every seed THIS extension has not delivered before, whether the collection is empty or not |

- **`key` is the identity of the seed**, and it never goes into the record: the platform remembers, per
  organization, which keys your extension has already delivered. You do not need a hidden "seed code"
  field. Keep the keys stable — a renamed key is a new seed.
- **A delivered seed belongs to the organization.** It renames it, edits it, deletes it; no later version
  of your extension brings it back or overwrites it. With `'required'`, a version that adds entries to
  the catalog delivers only the new keys to organizations that already have the extension.
- **Seeds are written by the server, after installing**, through the same path as an import: field rules,
  declared keys, default values and required fields all apply. A seed that collides with a declared key
  counts as delivered — the organization already has that record. A seed that is refused (the
  organization made a field required, a rule rejects the value) is retried on the next update of the
  extension.
- **Seeding is one Audit trail entry**, not one per record, and it does not fire
  `<collection>.saved`: a workflow listening to that event does not run once per breed. Records the
  organization changes afterwards publish and audit like any other.
- **A message reference in a text field (`text`, `textarea`, `markdown`) is resolved into the
  organization's language at the moment the record is written.** After that it is plain data: the
  organization edits it, and switching languages later does not translate it again. The reference must
  exist in your own `i18n.messages`.
- **What a seed cannot fill:** `reference` and `file` fields (the id of a record and the content of a file
  only exist in the organization), and fields no one writes — aggregated, derived, computed, sequential.
- At most 500 seeds per screen. A larger load is an import, not a starting catalog.
- `check` validates every seed against the screen's fields: types, option keys, required fields, the
  declared keys (two seeds with the same value are refused), and duplicate seed keys.
- Uninstalling leaves the seeded records — they are the organization's data — and the record of what was
  delivered, so reinstalling does not duplicate the catalog.

Screen seeds require kernel `^2.106.0`. An older kernel installs the screen without them.

### Adding to somebody else's screen

`screenPatches` add fields to a screen that already exists — another extension's, or the platform's:

```ts
screenPatches: [{ target: 'customers', targetKind: 'collection', fields: EXTRA_FIELDS }]
```

`targetKind: 'collection'` names a collection directly, which works because that name is universal.
`targetKind: 'sourceId'` names another extension's screen by its `sourceId`, which is the only stable
handle you have — the installed key differs per organization. The structure of the screen, its owner
and its configuration are untouched; you own only the fields you added, and uninstalling removes only
those. `cardActionIds` and `viewActionIds` let you hang your own actions on it; they are **added** to
what the organization configured, never substituted.

### Changing the shape of data you already wrote

That needs a `migration`: code that runs once per organization, in the server sandbox (§10),
converting what an earlier version of *your* extension wrote.

```ts
migrations: [{
  id: 'fill-invoice-number',       // permanent identity — this, not the version, is what is recorded as applied
  version: '1.2.0',
  name: label('migration.fill-number'),
  sourceTs: MIGRATION_SOURCE,      // TypeScript with no import/export/require
  phase: 'after',                  // 'before' only when the old field must still exist
  runOnInstall: false,
  required: true,
}]
```

Never hard-code a collection name — read it from `input.collections`, because the name can differ per
organization. Write it to be safely re-runnable: it may resume. `phase: 'before'` exists for the one
case that cannot work otherwise — copying an old field to a new one has to happen while both still
exist, because after the package converges the old one is no longer writable.

### Bulk import — what a file does to your screen

Anyone with `record-import.run` sees **Import** on the list of a screen where they can create
or change records. They pick a CSV or JSON file (up to 50000 rows), map each column to a
field, simulate, and import. You declare nothing to get this, and you cannot turn it off for a screen: the
gate is the permission, given by the organization, plus `<collection>.create` / `.update` charged on
EVERY row.

Each row is written on the server, in batches of 100, through the same path as the
"Upsert record" step and `create_record` over MCP. So everything you declared holds, with no code of yours:

- **Field rules, keys, sequence, edit window, record visibility** — refused rows are reported by their line
  in the file, with the same message the form would show. A `unique` value already taken is a refused row,
  never a duplicate.
- **`required` IS enforced** — on the record as it ends up (what was stored plus what the row brings). The
  "Upsert record" step does not enforce it; the import does, because a file of half-filled records is the
  mistake the form exists to prevent.
- **A `primary` key is the address.** A row whose primary key value already exists UPDATES that record
  (only the mapped, non-empty cells); otherwise it creates one. Importing the same file twice changes nothing
  the second time. A screen with no primary key can only CREATE, and importing twice creates twice — if
  your screen has a natural identifier, declare it as `primary` (see "Keys").
- **Files, nested objects, aggregated, derived and numbered fields are not offered** for mapping: a file
  cannot carry them, or the kernel computes them.
- **Every written record carries `createdVia` / `updatedVia: "import"`** and the importing person as author,
  and fires `<collection>.saved` like any other write. A workflow that must not run for each imported row
  (a welcome e-mail, say) tests it: `updatedVia != "import"`.
- **The audit trail** gets one line per record, as always, plus ONE line for the import itself — who, which
  screen, which file, and how many rows were created, updated and refused.

**Importing into a parent's tab.** The same **Import** shows on the tab of child records inside a parent —
the native child-screen tab, and a contributed tab drawn with `useEntityList(sourceId, { parent })` and
`RecordListSurface` — when the list is locked by ONE `reference` field to a single record (not `multi`,
not several fields). Nothing to declare:

- **The link to the parent is not a column.** It is left out of the mapping, and the server writes it on
  every row with the record that is open, after checking that the person can read that record (the parent's
  `<collection>.read` plus record visibility). An import keeps the parent it started with to the end.
- **It never moves a record between parents.** A row whose key finds a record linked to ANOTHER parent (or to
  none) is refused, not re-linked. So the child's `primary` key normally includes the link: items of an
  order are `primary: ['order', 'product']`, and the same product in another order is another record.
- **A custom tab drawn by hand** gets the same thing from `vm.recordImport`: call `open()` from your own
  button and mount `EntityListModals`. It is `null` wherever the import is not offered.

**A reference column can carry the target's KEY instead of its id.** A spreadsheet from outside has the tax
number or the registration code, not a document id. For a `reference` field whose target declares a key of
ONE field (`keys`, `primary` or `unique`), the mapping offers "<field> — find by <key field>" next to
"by record id". The cell then goes through the target field's rules and the key's `normalize`
(`formatPreset`, `caseInsensitive`, `trim`) exactly as the reservation did, and the server writes the id
of the record that holds it. On a `multi` reference, separate the values with `|` in the cell. A value no
record holds — or held by a record the person cannot read, or under a key still pending adoption — refuses
the row, with its line and the value, in the refused-rows report. Composite keys are not offered: one cell
is one value. Declare nothing new: the key you already declared is what the lookup uses.

What an import is not: a migration of YOUR data between versions (that is `migrations`, above), or a way
to write fields a person could not write in the form.

### The audit trail is not your evidence store — unless the organization makes it one

Every write to a screen's collection lands in the organization's audit trail (`auditActions` above says
which). It is there for LOOKUP: by default each entry expires after 30 days.
You do not declare retention, and you cannot: it is the organization's decision, under Audit trail >
Retention and archive, for whoever has `audit.manage`.

- **Lookup retention** — from 30 to 3650 days; applies to entries written from then on.
- **Archive with hash chain** — once a day (UTC), the previous day is copied to a bucket the installation
  declares, ideally with locked retention. Each line carries its SHA-256 and the previous day's hash; each
  day is locked for 5 years by default (up to 30) when the bucket supports
  per-object retention. A verification points at the first day where the chain stops closing.

What that means for what you model:

- **An event that is legal evidence is a RECORD of your screen, not an audit line.** "Notice delivered",
  "reading confirmed", "deadline started" belong in a child collection with `editWindow` (see "Edit
  window") — they last as long as the organization keeps them, whether or not the archive is on, and
  workflows and reports can read them. The audit trail then proves who wrote them and that they were not
  changed.
- **Do not rely on the archive being on.** It is opt-in per organization and needs the installation's
  bucket; a package cannot turn it on or require it.
- **What the archive does NOT stop** — say it plainly to whoever adopts your extension: the owner of the
  Firebase project can still alter or delete an audit entry in Firestore before its day is exported
  (about an hour after midnight UTC), turn the archive off (itself a CRITICAL audit entry and a declared gap
  in the chain) or delete the project. With a locked bucket nobody — project owners included — can delete
  or rewrite an archived day. With an unlocked one, only the last day's hash kept OUTSIDE the project
  proves the archive was not rewritten as a whole; the archive screen lets the organization copy it.

## 9. Expressions — the small language that shows up everywhere

One language, evaluated everywhere a declaration needs a decision. It is an expression, not a script:
no statements, no assignment, no side effects.

| Where | What it decides |
|---|---|
| `field.logic.compute` | the field's value, derived from the record and stored on save |
| `field.logic.derive` | the field's value, evaluated on every read and never stored |
| `field.logic.validate` | the error message: a text is the message shown, `null`, `''` or `false` accept the value, and any other result is the generic "invalid value". It is not a yes/no — `true` REFUSES |
| `field.logic.hiddenWhen`, `disabledWhen` | whether the field is shown, and whether it can be edited |
| `field.logic.onChange` | an object merged into the form when this field changes — seeds values the person can still edit |
| `field.aggregation.filter` | which child records enter the aggregate |
| `report.dataset.includeWhen` | which rows enter the report (§11) |
| `action.hiddenWhen`, `disabledWhen`, `activeWhen` | whether a button appears, is pressable, or reads as ON |
| `nav().badge.when` | which records the menu badge counts |
| workflow `condition` of `kind: 'Expression'`, and any `{ kind: 'Expression' }` input mapping | whether the automation runs, and what a step receives |

**The scope is what changes between them, and it is the thing that trips people up:**

| Slot | What is in scope |
|---|---|
| `compute`, `validate`, `derive` | the record's fields at the root, plus `value` (= `self`) — the field's own value. These three run on the client AND on the server, so they must not depend on anything else. A `derive` also sees the `compute` results; the reverse cannot happen, because `compute` runs on save and no derived value exists there |
| `hiddenWhen`, `disabledWhen`, `onChange` of a field | the above, plus `isNew` and `isDirty`. Client only |
| an action's expressions | the form's current values at the root, plus `record` (as stored, `{}` when new), `isNew`, `isDirty`, `permissions`, `surface` (`detail` / `list` / `parentTab`), `relation` (`none` / `owned` / `related`), `user`. A single `reference` field is navigable (`orderId.sellerId`, `orderId.customerId.regionId`) — see below. Client only |
| `badge.when` | each record's fields at the root, plus `user` |
| a report's `dataset.includeWhen` | each row's fields at the root, a reference navigated by the name of the record it points at (`client.city`), and `id`. Every path the expression names exists, and is `null` when the record has no value for it — so a field nobody filled in is empty, never an error. Server only, running as the reader: `hasPermission` answers for the person who opened the report |
| a workflow | `event.*` (the payload), the outputs of earlier steps, the workflow's variables, and `actor` — who triggered the run |

`user` is `{ id, name, permissions }`. A reserved name wins over a field of the same key — a field
called `record` is still reachable as `record.record`.

`actor`, in a workflow, is `{ id, name, via }` or `null`. `id` is the person's uid — the same value a
form writes in `createdBy` and the id of their `members` document —, `name` is their effective name
(nickname, then full name, then display name, then e-mail), and `via` is `"ui"` when they pressed a
button in the app and `"agent"` when an AI agent acted on their behalf over MCP. It is `null` where no
person caused the run: a `<collection>.saved` / `.deleted` trigger, and every flow those start. Test it
with `isEmpty(actor)`; `actor.name` there reads `null` instead of failing. A workflow variable named
`actor` does not shadow it. It is identity, not access: what the person may do is still
`hasPermission(...)`.

`actor.verified` is what a portal guest PROVED when signing in through one of the organization's identity
providers: `{ provider, claim: { name, value } | null, level }` — the provider's id, the claim the
invitation required, and the assurance level the provider reported, as it wrote it. It is `null` for every
member, for a guest who signed in by e-mail link, and when there is no actor; `actor.verified.level`
reads `null` there instead of failing.

| How the run started | `actor` | `hasPermission` answers for |
|---|---|---|
| an action (button), or `run_action` over MCP | the person, `via` `ui` / `agent` | that person (over MCP: the token's ceiling) |
| `run_workflow` (app or MCP) | the person | nobody — the run happens later, on the event bus, and access is not written there |
| `call-workflow` waiting for the result | the caller's actor | the caller's actor |
| `call-workflow` not waiting | the caller's actor | nobody — same reason as `run_workflow` |
| `<collection>.saved` / `.deleted` | `null` | nobody |

**Navigating a reference from an action.** In an action's expressions, a path that goes THROUGH a
single `reference` field reads the record it points at: `orderId.title`, and further,
`orderId.customerId.regionId`. Only what the expression navigates is swapped — a reference read on its
own is still the id, so `parameterDefaults: { customerId: 'customerId' }`, `isEmpty(orderId)` and
`orderId == "abc"` mean what they always meant — even inside an expression that also navigates it:
in `concat(orderId, " ", orderId.title)` the first `orderId` is the id. `orderId.id` is the id too. A
`multi` reference is not navigable here. Workflows follow the same rule (§10).

A path with nothing at the end of it is `null`, never an error: an empty reference, a deleted record,
and a record in a collection the viewer cannot read all answer `null` along the way — a value only
reaches the expression if the person could open the record it came from.

When the pointed-at record is fetched depends on the slot:

| Slot | Pointed-at record |
|---|---|
| `hiddenWhen`, `disabledWhen`, `activeWhen` | synchronous: what the client already holds. A record not loaded yet reads as `null` — the button is drawn, never hidden by mistake |
| `parameterDefaults` | on demand: the form waits a moment for the records the expression navigates, then opens |

### Computed or derived — the question is whether the expression asks the clock

`compute` and `derive` both give a field its value from an expression. The difference is WHEN, and
picking the wrong one produces a field that lies without ever failing.

`compute` runs on save and the value is stored. That is what you want when the value depends only on
the record: a total, a full name, a composed label. It sits in the document, so it is indexable,
filterable and sortable on the server, and it cannot go stale — nothing outside the record moved.

`derive` runs on every read and is never stored. Reach for it the moment the expression asks the
clock — `today()`, `now()`, an age, a countdown, whether a due date has passed. Stored, that answer
is the answer of the day it was saved: a record saved today as on time stays on time a year later,
and nothing in the system ever comes back to correct it. Derived, it answers about the moment someone
is looking.

What you give up is storage, and everything that follows from it. A derived value does not exist in
the document: it never becomes a Firestore index or an equality filter on the server, and a parent
field cannot aggregate over it (the aggregate IS stored, so it would freeze the same way). Filtering
and sorting still work — in memory, over the records already loaded, exactly as a filter across a
link field does. It is read-only in the form, and it is stripped from every write, so `compute` and
`validate` cannot see it: both of those run on save, where no derived value exists.

### `today()` is the organization's day

An instant is the same everywhere; the day it falls on is not. At 10 p.m. in Brasília it is already
tomorrow in UTC. `today()` answers the day **in the organization's time zone** — the
`i18n.timezone` setting under Settings → Language and region, resolved person → organization →
automatic. Automatic follows the organization's language: `pt-BR` means `America/Sao_Paulo`,
anything without a known region means `UTC`.

The same rule runs everywhere the expression does — the form, a `derive` read in the browser or on
the server, a workflow, a report's `includeWhen` — so `dueDate < today()` cannot be true on the
screen and false in the automation that acts on it. Do not compensate for the time zone yourself:
`addDays(today(), -1)` "to fix the evening" is wrong for every organization the day the setting changes.

`now()` stays an **instant**. Compare it with other instants (`dateDiff(now(), createdAt, "hours")`);
when you need a day, ask `today()` instead of cutting one out of `now()`.

### `formatDate` writes the organization's clock

`formatDate(v, fmt)` reads an instant on the clock of the same time zone `today()` uses, everywhere
the expression runs — the form, a `derive` on the server, a workflow, a Script's `fn.formatDate`, a
report's `includeWhen` and a document template. `formatDate(now(), "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm")` at 11 p.m. in
Brasília is `2026-03-30 23:00` on the screen and in the automation alike; without it, a server in UTC
would stamp the next day at 02:00. `year`, `month`, `day`, `dayOfWeek` and `isWeekend` read the
same clock.

A day is not converted: `formatDate("2026-03-31", "DD/MM/YYYY")` is `31/03/2026` in every time zone,
and so is a date field. A third argument, an IANA time zone, reads another
clock: `formatDate(now(), "HH:mm", "UTC")`. A name the platform does not know is an empty text in a
field expression and a named refusal in a workflow — never the hour of some other zone. Do not shift the
hour yourself (`addDays(now(), -0.125)`): it is wrong for every organization outside one zone, and
wrong for that one the day it changes its setting.

### Asking about permission

`hasPermission("...")` is the one function that answers about who is looking, and it takes patterns:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---|---|
| `hasPermission("invoices.approve")` | that exact permission |
| `hasPermission("<entity>.delete")` | the delete of the screen the expression is being evaluated in |
| `hasPermission("*.delete")` | the delete of any resource |
| `hasPermission("invoices.*")` | any action on `invoices` |
| `hasPermission("invoice%.read")` | the read of every resource starting with `invoice` |

Prefer `<entity>`: it is what lets one action serve every screen instead of naming one.

**What the answer is for: drawing.** Show the button to whoever can press it. What actually blocks a
write is the server rule, and it is not negotiable from your side — an extension that decided access
by this answer would be deciding in the wrong place.

### The functions

Operators are the usual ones — `+ - * / % ^`, `== != > >= < <=`, `and or not`, `? :`, `in`, and `!` is
logical negation. On top of them:

| Group | |
|---|---|
| Logic | `if(cond, a, b)`, `coalesce(...)`, `isEmpty(v)`, `isNull(v)`, `isNotNull(v)` |
| Text | `concat(...)`, `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `length`, `contains(v, s)`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`, `substring(v, start, end)`, `replace(v, s, r)`, `split(v, sep)`, `join(a, sep)`, `interpolate(template, ...)` |
| Numbers | `round(v, decimals)`, `sum(a)`, `avg(a)`, `min`, `max`, `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `sqrt` |
| Dates | `today()`, `now()`, `addDays(v, n)`, `formatDate(v, fmt, timeZone?)`, `dateDiff(a, b, unit)`, `dayOfWeek`, `isWeekend`, `year`, `month`, `day` |
| Business days | `addBusinessDays(v, n, calendars)`, `businessDaysBetween(a, b, calendars)`, `isBusinessDay(v, calendars)`, `nextBusinessDay(v, calendars)` — see below |
| Lists | `first(a)`, `last(a)`, `map(a, path, compact)`, `contains(a, item)`, `length(a)` |
| Brazil, and formatting | `isCPF`, `isCNPJ`, `isEmail`, `onlyNumber`, `formatCPF`, `formatCNPJ`, `formatMoney(v, locale)` |
| Check digits | `mod97(text)` — the ISO 7064 mod 97-10 remainder, computed over the text so a 20-digit number keeps every digit; letters A–Z count 10–35, anything else (or empty) is `null`. Move the check digits to the end first: `mod97(concat(substring(d, 0, 7), substring(d, 9, 20), substring(d, 7, 9))) == 1` checks a CNJ number, `98 - mod97(base + "00")` computes them |
| Objects | `object(k, v, ...)`, `delete(key, target)` |
| Access | `hasPermission(pattern)` |

An empty value never makes an expression fail, on a screen or in a workflow: a member of `null` is
`null`, so `isEmpty(output.query.first.title)` over a query that found nothing is `true`. A path
that does not exist at all is still an error — `event.payload.title` in a workflow, where `event` is
already the payload, fails the run instead of quietly writing nothing. `and` and `or` stop
at the side that decides, and `? :` and `if(cond, a, b)` evaluate only the branch they pick — every
other function receives its arguments already evaluated.

### Business days

The kernel counts business days; it does not know where the calendars live. An extension tells it,
with one contribution — `businessCalendarContribution({ collection: 'businessCalendars' })`, on the
point `time.business.calendar` — and every document of that collection is a calendar:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `key` | what a formula writes to name the calendar (the document id works too) |
| `name` | how the office calls it — only used to say which calendar a refusal is about |
| `weekend` | weekdays that are never business days, `0` = Sunday … `6` = Saturday |
| `years` | year → the `YYYY-MM-DD` days of that year that are not business days |

A formula names one calendar or several — a text, a list, or a reference field that points at
calendars — and counts with their UNION: a day that is not a business day in any of them is skipped.

```
addBusinessDays(start, 15, ["national", "regional"])   // the 15th business day AFTER start
businessDaysBetween(start, end, "national")            // business days in (start, end]
isBusinessDay(today(), calendars)
nextBusinessDay(addDays(start, 15), "national")        // start itself if it is one, else the next
```

`addBusinessDays(d, n)` never counts `d` itself, and `businessDaysBetween(d, addBusinessDays(d, n))` is
always `n`. Doubling a term is `n * 2`; "the first business day after, then n more" is two calls.

**A count never answers by omission.** No extension declaring calendars, a calendar that does not
exist, a year the calendar never registered: each one is a named refusal. In `compute` and
`validate` it blocks the save and says why — unlike every other expression error, which is
tolerated. In `derive` the field reads empty. A date counted without the holidays is a wrong date
nobody notices, and that is the one failure a deadline cannot have.

The server reads the calendars only for an evaluation that calls one of these functions, so a
collection that never counts business days pays nothing for the capability.

The complete set the installed platform resolves, derived from it rather than from this table:

`if`, `concat`, `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `length`, `isEmpty`, `isNull`, `isNotNull`, `coalesce`, `onlyNumber`, `isCPF`, `isCNPJ`, `mod97`, `isEmail`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`, `substring`, `replace`, `split`, `join`, `interpolate`, `formatMoney`, `formatCPF`, `formatCNPJ`, `round`, `sum`, `avg`, `first`, `last`, `delete`, `today`, `now`, `addDays`, `formatDate`, `dateDiff`, `addBusinessDays`, `businessDaysBetween`, `isBusinessDay`, `nextBusinessDay`, `dayOfWeek`, `isWeekend`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `object`, `hasPermission`, `map`, `abs`, `ceil`, `floor`, `min`, `max`, `sqrt`

**Same name, two engines.** A field or action expression and an automation are evaluated by different
engines, and a few functions answer differently — the served `microteia://expression-functions` lists them:

| Function | Field or action expression | Automation |
|---|---|---|
| `coalesce` | skips null, undefined, empty text and an empty list | skips only null and undefined — an empty text is returned |
| `isEmpty` | an empty object is NOT empty | an empty object IS empty, and so is an invalid date |
| `formatMoney` | defaults to the language of whoever is looking; the second argument is any language tag | defaults to pt-br (R$); the second argument is pt-br, en-us, en-gb or es-es, anything else falls back to pt-br |

## 10. Automation — workflows, actions and scripts

Three artifacts, and the distinction is what starts them:

| | Starts when | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| **workflow** | a record changes, a list changes, a schedule comes due, a date of a record arrives, or another workflow calls it | on the server |
| **action** | a person presses a button on a record | fires a workflow, or a platform command |
| **script** | a workflow step runs it | in the server sandbox |

### Workflows

```ts
workflows: [{
  templateId: 'wf-welcome',           // how actions and other workflows reference it
  name: label('workflow.welcome'),
  description: label('workflow.welcome.description'),
  eventName: 'invoices.saved',
  version: 1,
  condition: {
    kind: 'FieldComparison',
    fieldPath: 'event.payload.changeType',   // ABSOLUTE path, over the whole context
    operator: '==',
    value: 'created',
    valueType: 'literal',
  },
  steps: [{
    id: 'audit',
    stepDefinitionId: 'register-audit',
    type: 'Action',
    order: 0,
    enabled: true,
    configuration: {
      title: { kind: 'Literal', value: label('workflow.welcome.title') },
      message: { kind: 'Expression', expression: 'concat("Welcome, ", event.name, "!")' },
      entityId: { kind: 'Event', path: 'id' },     // path RELATIVE to event.payload
    },
  }],
}]
```

**`eventName`** is `<collection>.saved` or `<collection>.deleted` — for your own screens, for a screen
the organization designed, for a collection that already exists. Also `lookup.saved` / `lookup.deleted`
(with `lookupCollection` naming which list), `<prefix>_note.saved` / `.deleted` and the same for
`document` (`<prefix>` is the parent screen's `eventPrefix`, or its collection), `workflow.called` for a workflow that only exists to be invoked — that one declares
`parameters`, which become the `event.` it receives —, `schedule` for one the clock starts,
`<collection>.dateReached` for one that runs when a date of a record arrives, `<collection>.portalViewed`
for one that runs when a portal guest opens a record (see below), and `audit.recorded` for
one that reacts to an entry of the organization's Audit trail (`event.severity`, `event.action`,
`event.entity`… — requires kernel 2.45.0 or later). Only entries a PERSON caused fire it: what the kernel
or an automation writes to the trail never does, which is what keeps the trigger from feeding itself.
Steps that would write back to the trail (`register-audit`, `remove`) are refused in that workflow —
each step's catalog entry lists the triggers it refuses in `excludedTriggers`.

### A workflow that runs on a schedule

```ts
workflows: [{
  templateId: 'wf-overdue',
  name: label('workflow.overdue'),
  eventName: 'schedule',
  schedule: { cron: '0 8 * * MON-FRI' },     // weekdays at 08:00, in the organization's time zone
  version: 1,
  condition: { kind: 'AlwaysTrue' },
  steps: [/* a `query` for the records it is about, then a `Loop` over them */],
}]
```

The kernel has ONE clock for the whole project, and it wakes a scheduled workflow in every organization
where that workflow exists — which is every organization that installed your extension and has not
deactivated it. You write no Cloud Function, and the organization provisions nothing.

- **`cron`** has five fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week; names like `MON` and `JAN`
  work) or is one of `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`. It may not fire more often than every
  15 minutes, and the clock checks every 5: `0 8 * * *` starts within 5 minutes after 08:00.
  `validate_plugin` refuses an expression the clock cannot run, because that workflow would install switched
  on and never fire.
- **The time zone is the organization's** (`i18n.timezone`). `schedule.timeZone` overrides it with an IANA
  name, and in an extension it is almost always wrong: you ship to organizations in other zones, and "at 8"
  means at 8 in each of them.
- **`event` carries no record**: only `scheduledFor` (the instant the cron named) and `firedAt` (when it ran).
  Query what the run is about. `actor` is `null` — nobody pressed anything, so `hasPermission` answers false.
- **A clock that was down fires once, not once per missed time.** A daily workflow that missed three days runs
  one time when the clock comes back.

### A workflow that runs when a date arrives

```ts
workflows: [{
  templateId: 'wf-due-soon',
  name: label('workflow.due-soon'),
  eventName: 'invoices.dateReached',
  dateReached: { field: 'dueDate', offset: '-3d', at: '08:00' },   // three days before, at 08:00
  version: 1,
  condition: { kind: 'AlwaysTrue' },
  steps: [/* event is the record — the same payload as invoices.saved */],
}]
```

Reminders, renewals, overdue charges, triage deadlines: "when this date comes" is the most common schedule in
a business rule, and it is NOT a cron plus a query — the kernel already knows which records are due.

- **`field`** is a `date` field of the screen that emits the prefix. `validate_plugin` refuses any other when
  that screen is in your package.
- **`offset`** is whole days: `-3d` three days before, `0d` on the day, `+1d` the day after (up to
  365 either way). To warn at D-3, D-1 and D-0, declare three workflows.
- **`at`** is `HH:mm` in the organization's time zone, 08:00 when omitted.
- **Once per record and per date.** The kernel keeps the mark: a record fires once for its date, and fires again
  if the date changes. A record that reaches its day AFTER `at` — created today, due today — fires when it is
  saved instead of waiting for tomorrow.
- **Never retroactively.** Dates that arrived before the workflow existed do not fire, and a clock that was down
  recovers at most 7 days.
- **`event` is the record**, like `<collection>.saved` without `changeType` and `old`; `actor` is `null`.

`schedule` needs kernel 2.32.0 or later, and `dateReached` 2.33.0. On an earlier
kernel the workflow installs and never fires, so `validate_plugin` refuses a package whose `kernel` range starts
below the one its trigger needs.

**Listening to another extension.** A workflow may listen to `<prefix>.saved` / `<prefix>.deleted` of
a collection a **declared dependency** brings. The name is the prefix that screen EMITS — its
`eventPrefix`, or its collection when it declares none —, which is not always the collection: a screen
over `orders` declaring `eventPrefix: 'order'` emits `order.saved`. Declare the extension in
`manifest.dependencies` (listing `collections` is not needed for this, and `order` is no collection):

```ts
dependencies: { 'com.acme.orders': { version: '^2.0.0', collections: ['orders'] } },
workflows: [{ templateId: 'link-on-order', name: 'Link on new order', eventName: 'order.saved', /* … */ }],
```

The prefix is resolved against the screens of your dependencies. **On install**, every package is in
view, and a prefix no declared dependency emits is refused — naming the prefix. **In `check`**, the
dependencies are the `plugin.ts` files in this workspace and the `installed-catalog.json`; a prefix
emitted by an extension you did NOT declare is refused, and one no visible source emits is a warning that
says so (take a snapshot of the installation to close the gap — see "What the organization actually runs"). With no dependency declared at all, there is
nowhere to look, and the trigger is refused.

**`condition`** is evaluated once, before any step: `AlwaysTrue`, `FieldComparison`, `LogicalAnd`,
`LogicalOr`, `Not`, or `Expression`.

**Every step input is an `InputMapping`**, and the five kinds are the whole of how data moves:

| | |
|---|---|
| `{ kind: 'Literal', value }` | a constant |
| `{ kind: 'Event', path }` | a path **inside `event.payload`** — relative |
| `{ kind: 'Expression', expression }` | an expression over the whole context (§9) — there `event` **is** the payload: `event.title`, never `event.payload.title` |
| `{ kind: 'Output', stepId, outputId }` | what an earlier step produced |
| `{ kind: 'Variable', name }` | a workflow variable |

**Navigating a reference in a workflow.** The rule is the one actions follow (§9): the record a
`reference` points at is read only when the path names a field AFTER the reference. In a workflow,
`event.<reference>` on its own is the stored id — `event.orderId` is `"k1"`, never the order —
and `event.<reference>.<field>` reads the record it points at: `event.orderId.region`. The same holds
for `{ kind: 'Event', path: 'orderId' }` and for a `FieldComparison`. A `multi` reference read on
its own is the list of ids as stored; `event.calendars.name` is one name per record it points at.
An empty reference is `null` both ways, never an error.

It holds for the whole run, not just for one expression: a step that navigates `event.orderId.region`
does not change what another step copying `event.orderId` receives. So a `map` that mirrors a record
into another (`orderId: event.orderId`) writes the id, and a recipient that is a person LINKED to a
member is `event.sellerId.memberId`, not `event.sellerId`.

| Step type | |
|---|---|
| `Action` | Runs one entry of the platform's step catalog, named by `stepDefinitionId`. Its inputs are `configuration`. |
| `Condition` | A control node: `condition` decides which of `branches.whenTrue` / `branches.whenFalse` runs, and the flow converges after. `stepDefinitionId` is empty. |
| `Delay` | **Not a step type of its own.** It is in the union for compatibility, and a step declared with it stops the flow at that point — `validate_plugin` refuses it. To wait, use the `delay` catalog step (`type: 'Action'`, `stepDefinitionId: 'delay'`, §10); to act at a time, a workflow with `eventName: 'schedule'`. |
| `Loop` | A control node: `loop: { source, itemName, outputName, body }` runs `body` once per item and publishes the collected outputs under `outputName`. `stepDefinitionId` is empty. |
| `Script` | Runs a script, named by `configuration.scriptId` as a `Literal` — a `templateId` of your own package, or `<extension-id>/<source-id>` for a script another extension exports (§3). |
| `SubWorkflow` | Calls another workflow, named by `configuration.targetWorkflowId` as a `Literal` — again a `templateId`, or a qualified reference. |

`stepDefinitionId` names an entry of the platform's **step catalog**. These are the ones the kernel
brings; an extension may contribute more to the `workflow.step` point, so a package that declares a
dependency may name an id that is not listed here.

| `stepDefinitionId` | What it does | Takes | Publishes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notify` | Notifies people in the app (the bell), by e-mail or by push, and/or writes it to the audit trail. With no channel set it only writes to the audit trail, as version 1 did. Recipients come from `recipientMembers`, `recipientsFrom` (a member id, or a record linked to one by `memberId` — a reference read on its own is an id, so a person linked to a member is `event.contactId.memberId`) and `recipientPermission`; each person keeps or refuses a channel in Settings, and `title`/`message` resolve in each recipient's language. Clicking it opens the record that triggered the flow (`openRecord`, on by default) — in the app, in the browser notification and in the e-mail. Set `category` to one of your declared notification types (`<package id>/<key>`, see `notificationCategory`) so each person can choose, on the Notifications page, which channels bring them that type. With `portalGuests` it notifies the portal guests who can see the record instead of members (see "Telling the portal's guests" in section 10). With `recipientAddresses` / `recipientPhones` it writes to addresses read from fields the screen declares `contact` — people with no account at all —, by e-mail and SMS (`toSms`), with an unsubscribe link and one audit entry per send (see "Reaching an address from the record" in section 10). Publishes `recipients`, `delivered.<channel>`, `failed.<channel>` and `optedOut`. | `title`: String, `message`: String, `messageParams?`: Expression, `link?`: String, `openRecord?`: Boolean, `category?`: String, `toAudit?`: Boolean, `toInApp?`: Boolean, `toEmail?`: Boolean, `toPush?`: Boolean, `toSms?`: Boolean, `recipientMembers?`: EntityReference, `recipientsFrom?`: Expression, `recipientPermission?`: String, `portalGuests?`: Boolean, `portalRecord?`: Expression, `recipientAddresses?`: Expression, `recipientPhones?`: Expression | `recipients`, `delivered.audit`, `delivered.inApp`, `delivered.email`, `delivered.push`, `delivered.sms`, `failed.audit`, `failed.inApp`, `failed.email`, `failed.push`, `failed.sms`, `optedOut` |
| `register-audit` | Writes an entry in the audit trail. `severity` defaults to `LOW`. | `title`: String, `message`: String, `severity`: String, `entity?`: String, `entityId?`: String | — |
| `set-variable` | Names a value for the rest of the flow. Read it back with `{ kind: 'Variable' }`. | `name`: String, `value`: Expression | _(named at runtime)_ |
| `map` | Assembles an object from other values — what a write step then writes. | `map`: Map | _(named at runtime)_ |
| `validate-object` | Checks an object against a screen's rules before anything is written. | `validate`: Validate | _(named at runtime)_ |
| `exit` | Ends the flow here, successfully. Takes nothing. | — | — |
| `delay` | Pauses the run and continues it later, in the same run — `duration` (`30m`, `4h`, `2d`) or `until`. Top level only, and only in a run started by an event. | `duration?`: String, `until?`: Date | `resumeAt` |
| `call-workflow` | Runs another workflow of this package. `waitForResult` decides whether this flow waits. The target may be a `Literal` id or come from an earlier output; `params` carries the parameters in bulk. | `targetWorkflowId`: String, `params?`: Expression, `waitForResult?`: Boolean | _(named at runtime)_ |
| `script` | Runs one of your `scripts` in the server sandbox. | `scriptId`: String | _(named at runtime)_ |
| `ai-detect-workflow` | Asks a model which callable workflow fits a free text, reading their descriptions. No match is a success with `found` false. | `text`: String, `connectionId?`: String | `found`, `workflowId`, `workflowName`, `candidates` |
| `ai-extract-parameters` | Asks a model to fill the parameters of a target workflow from a free text. Publishes `params`, plus `params.<key>` when the target is a `Literal`. | `text`: String, `targetWorkflowId`: String, `connectionId?`: String | `params`, `filled` |
| `query` | Asks the database. Publishes `count`, `results`, `first`, plus `first.<projection>`. | `query`: Query | `count`, `results`, `first`, `hasMore`, `cursor` |
| `upsert` | Writes one record. An `id` in the object means update, no `id` means insert — or, with `matchPrimaryKey: true`, update the record that holds the same `primary` key. | `upsert`: Upsert | `id`, `created`, `record` |
| `remove` | Deletes one record. | `remove`: Remove | `id`, `removed` |
| `render-document` | Fills a document template (`document.template`, or the organization's own on the same key) with a record and attaches the PDF or Word file to its Documents tab. The template names the screen; `recordId` must be a record of it. `portalShared: true` attaches it already shared with the portal (see "Sharing documents with the portal" in section 10). Publishes `documentId`, `name`, `url`, `format` and `emptyFields`. | `templateKey`: String, `recordId?`: String, `payload?`: Expression, `belongsTo?`: String, `output?`: String, `fileName?`: String, `documentType?`: String, `destination?`: String, `expiresInDays?`: Number, `portalShared?`: Boolean | `documentId`, `name`, `url`, `format`, `emptyFields`, `destination`, `expiresAt` |
| `share-documents` | Shares the documents a record already has with the portal guests who can see that record (`shared: true`, the default), or stops sharing them (`false`). `collection` and `recordId` name the record; `documentId` narrows it to one document — one not attached to that record fails the step — and `documentType` to one type. Idempotent. Publishes `matched`, `changed` and `shared`. | `collection`: String, `recordId`: String, `shared?`: Boolean, `documentId?`: String, `documentType?`: String | `matched`, `changed`, `shared` |
| `portal-invite` | Invites `email` to the portal, to the record `subjectRecordId` of `subjectCollection` — the same invitation as Settings › Portal. Only on a screen declaring `portal: { subject: 'self', invites: { automation: true } }`. Idempotent per e-mail and record; `sendEmail` (on by default) sends the welcome e-mail only to whoever was just invited. Publishes `guestId`, `created`, `granted` and `emailed` (see "Inviting to the portal" in section 10). | `subjectCollection`: String, `subjectRecordId`: String, `email`: String, `displayName?`: String, `role?`: String, `sendEmail?`: Boolean, `requiredClaimName?`: String, `requiredClaimValue?`: String, `requiredClaimNormalize?`: String | `guestId`, `created`, `granted`, `emailed`, `inviteId`, `roleChanged` |
| `portal-revoke` | Removes the access of `email` to the record `subjectRecordId` of `subjectCollection` in the portal, at once — with `allSubjects`, the whole invitation, if they have that record. Someone without access changes nothing. Publishes `guestId` and `revoked`. | `subjectCollection`: String, `subjectRecordId`: String, `email`: String, `allSubjects?`: Boolean | `guestId`, `revoked` |
| `http-request` | Calls a REST API and waits for the answer (kernel 2.101.0+). `request` is a literal `HttpRequestSpec`: `method`, `url` (with `{name}` placeholders filled by `pathParams`), `query`, `headers`, `body` (`none`, `json`, `json-from`, `form`, `text`), `timeoutSeconds` (1–120), `failOnHttpError`, `responseType` and `responseSample`; every value inside is an ordinary mapping. Only `https` to a domain the office allows in Settings › Integrations — the package cannot allow one. Secrets never go in the package: name an office credential by key in `connection` (kernel 2.102.0+), which the office creates with that key; a secret-looking header with a literal value is refused. Publishes `ok`, `status`, `headers`, `body`, `durationMs`, `error`, `timedOut`, plus `body.<path>` from `responseSample`. With `mode: 'async'` (kernel 2.103.0+) the request goes to a durable queue and the flow does not wait: the step publishes only `dispatchId`, temporary failures (network, timeout, 408, 429, 5xx) are retried up to `retries` times (0–5, default 3), and the workflow named in `targetWorkflowId` — a `workflow.called` flow of this package, with its other parameters as `param.<key>` — receives the result in a parameter named `response` (`ok`, `status`, `headers`, `body`, `error`, `attempts`, `dispatchId`). | `request`: HttpRequest, `targetWorkflowId?`: String | `dispatchId`, `ok`, `status`, `body`, `headers`, `durationMs`, `error`, `timedOut` |

**A composite input is a `Literal` wrapping a whole config object, and the type is not the one its
name suggests.** `query` really does take a `QuerySpec`; the other four do NOT take a matching
`…Spec`:

| Input type | The type inside the `Literal` | |
|---|---|---|
| `Query` | `QuerySpec` | `{ table, where, orderBy?, limit, projections, page? }` — see "How much a query reads" below |
| `Upsert` | `UpsertStepConfig` | `{ table, source: 'input' \| 'event', property?, matchPrimaryKey? }` — no `data`: the step reads the object from `source`, and an `id` in it means update; `matchPrimaryKey: true` updates, with no `id`, the record that holds the same `primary` key (§8) |
| `Remove` | `RemoveStepConfig` | `{ table, id }` |
| `Map` | `MapStepConfig` | `{ name?, type?, fields: { name, value }[] }` |
| `Validate` | `ValidateStepConfig` | ask `describe_sdk_type` |

Writing `UpsertSpec` where `UpsertStepConfig` belongs is the single most common mistake in an
automation, and it used to be invisible: the package validated and the flow silently wrote nothing.
`check` now refuses it.

**Who wrote it is stamped for you, and cannot be written by you.** An `upsert` — the step, a script's
`upsert()`, or `create_record` / `update_record` over MCP — records the author exactly as the form does:
`createdBy` / `updatedBy` is the `actor`'s uid, `createdByName` / `updatedByName` and the photo come
from the same rule, and `createdVia` / `updatedVia` says how the write came in — `"ui"`, `"agent"`, `"portal"`,
`"import"` (a bulk import, see §8) or, with no person behind the run, `"automation"` (the author is then
`workflow-engine`). Every one of those
fields is managed by the system: a mapping or a `data` object that names them is refused, or dropped by the
step. So is `portalVerified`, the identity a portal guest proved when the write came through the portal. So "who registered this" and "typed or by the AI" need no field of yours — read them off the record.

**`QuerySpec.where` uses the operator NAMES**, not the symbols: `eq`, `neq`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`,
`gte`, `in`, `contains`, `exists`. An operator outside that set matches no rows at all — the query
returns nothing and the flow carries on as if the records did not exist.

### How much a query reads — and reading a large collection in pages

A `query` step — and a script's `query()` — reads at most **300 documents** from the database
and returns at most **100 records**. A larger `limit` is cut to 100; `check` warns
about it, and never refuses, because a flow written that way has always run returning 100.

- **Only `eq` goes to the database**, on a field stored in the record (a reference's id included). Every
  other operator, a path into a referenced record (`customer.city`), a derived field and `orderBy` are
  applied in memory, to the documents read. A range filter or a sort sees the first 300 documents
  the `eq` filters select — not the whole collection. Narrow with `eq` first.
- **`hasMore`** — an output of the step, a field of `query()`'s result — is `true` when records were left
  out, by the limit or by the read ceiling. A flow that must see everything checks it instead of trusting
  `count`.

When the collection is larger than one query, read it in **pages**:

```ts
configuration: {
  query: { kind: 'Literal', value: {
    table: 'recipients',
    where: [{ path: 'batchId', op: 'eq', value: { kind: 'Expression', expression: 'event.id' } }],
    limit: 100,
    projections: ['name', 'email'],
    page: { after: { kind: 'Expression', expression: 'event.cursor' } },   // empty on the first page
  } },
},
```

- **Pages follow the record id**, not a field — so `orderBy` is refused together with `page`. Each page
  returns up to `limit` records and publishes **`cursor`**: pass it back as `page.after` to read the next
  page; it is `null` after the last one. Every record that matches comes in exactly one page, whatever the
  filters kept in memory leave out of each read.
- **One page per run.** A run reads a page, works through it with a `Loop`, and leaves the cursor where the
  next run reads it — typically a field of the record that drives the work (the batch above), written by an
  `upsert` and read back as `event.cursor` by a `schedule` or a `<collection>.saved` workflow. Stop when
  `cursor` is `null`.
- `page: {}` or an empty `after` reads the first page. An `after` that is not a cursor — a number, an object —
  fails the step instead of starting over, which would read the first page forever.
- A script pages the same way: `await query({ table, where, limit, page: { after: cursor } })` returns
  `cursor` and `hasMore`.
- `page` needs kernel 2.83.0 or later: `validate_plugin` refuses it in a package whose `kernel`
  range starts below, where the option is ignored and no cursor is ever published.

**Paging is for the exceptional sweep.** Work that happens once per record is better declared per record: a
`<collection>.saved` workflow on each item — the bulk import (§8) fires it for every row — or `dateReached`.
Each record then gets its own run, its own line in the history and its own failure, instead of one run that
has to remember where it stopped.

Ask the MCP server rather than guessing any of this: `microteia://workflow/steps` for the catalog,
`describe_workflow_step` for one step's exact inputs and outputs, `list_workflow_events` for the
trigger names. All three are derived from this installation.

### Telling the portal's guests

A `notify` step with `portalGuests` notifies the people OUTSIDE the organization who can see a record
in the portal — the customer of an order, the supplier of an invoice — instead of members:

```ts
{
  id: 'tellClient',
  stepDefinitionId: 'notify',
  type: 'Action',
  order: 0,
  enabled: true,
  configuration: {
    title: { kind: 'Literal', value: label('notify.reply.title') },
    message: { kind: 'Literal', value: label('notify.reply.message') },
    portalGuests: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },
    toEmail: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },
    toInApp: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },        // the bell of the PORTAL
    toAudit: { kind: 'Literal', value: false },
    portalRecord: { kind: 'Event', path: 'orderId' },  // optional — see below
  },
}
```

- **Who receives** is decided when the step runs, by the same chain that decides what the portal shows
  (section 8, `portal`): the active guests of the subject the record reaches, with `visibleWhen` on every
  link. A record that is not in the portal notifies nobody — not even that it exists. A revoked invite
  stops receiving at once. You never name a guest, and an e-mail typed in a field is never used.
- **Which record.** By default, the record of the event. `portalRecord` names another one as an `Event`
  path (`orderId`, `conversationId.customerId`): the path has a type, and that is how the step knows the
  collection. A path that does not lead to a record fails the step; the right path that came empty in
  this run only notifies nobody, and the log says so.
- **Never members in the same step.** `portalGuests` with `recipientMembers`, `recipientsFrom` or
  `recipientPermission` fails the step. One step for the organization, another for the portal: the text
  is written for someone outside, so keep in it only what that screen's `portal.fields` already show —
  a value read from the record in `messageParams` leaves the organization in the e-mail.
- **Channels.** E-mail and the portal's bell. Push does not reach guests, and they have no preferences of
  their own: the organization's channel defaults apply. The link opens the record IN THE PORTAL. `title`
  and `message` resolve on the server in the language of the invite, so your `@<package>/<key>`
  references work even if the package draws nothing in the portal.
- **It leaves a trace.** Every delivery to guests writes an entry in the organization's Audit trail —
  how many, about which record, what it said —, whatever `toAudit` says.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.63.0"`. An older kernel ignores `portalGuests`, and
  the step fails for lack of recipients.

`examples/portal-example` tells the client when a visit is scheduled.

### Reaching an address from the record

Members have an account, guests have an invite. Sometimes the person you must tell has neither — the
taxpayer who has not activated the portal yet, the supplier who only left an e-mail on the order. For
that case, and only for it, a `notify` step writes to an ADDRESS read from the record:

```ts
// the screen says which fields are contacts
fields: [
  { key: 'email', label: label('field.email'), type: 'text', order: 3, required: false, contact: 'email' },
  { key: 'mobile', label: label('field.mobile'), type: 'masked', mask: 'phone', order: 4, required: false, contact: 'phone' },
],

// the step says which of them to reach
configuration: {
  title: { kind: 'Literal', value: label('notify.pending.title') },
  message: { kind: 'Literal', value: label('notify.pending.message') },
  recipientAddresses: { kind: 'Event', path: 'companyId.email' },
  recipientPhones: { kind: 'Event', path: 'companyId.mobile' },
  toEmail: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },
  toSms: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },
  toAudit: { kind: 'Literal', value: false },
},
```

- **Two declarations, on purpose.** The field must declare `contact` on its screen, and the input must be
  an `Event` path that ends on it — through references too (`companyId.email`). An expression, a
  literal, or a path to a field without `contact` (or with the other kind) fails the step: what is an
  e-mail is decided by whoever designed the screen, never by a value that looks like one.
- **In a called workflow** (`workflow.called`), the path starts at the declared `parameters`, as
  everywhere else in that workflow: an `EntityReference` parameter followed by the record's fields
  (`order.companyId.email`) reaches the contact, and `portalRecord` may name the parameter itself.
  Requires `kernel: "^2.93.0"` — an older kernel resolved the path
  against the event, which has no fields, and failed the step on every run.
- **Its own audience.** With `recipientMembers`, `recipientsFrom`, `recipientPermission` or
  `portalGuests` in the same step, it fails. Write the text for someone outside the organization.
- **Channels.** `recipientAddresses` goes by e-mail (`toEmail`), `recipientPhones` by SMS (`toSms`); a
  configured input with no channel that reaches it fails the step. The bell and push never reach an
  address. SMS uses the provider the organization set up (`twilio`, `webhook`); a `webhook`
  receives `{ to, body }` and is the bridge to any other provider. A number saved without a country
  code gets the organization's default.
- **Values.** A field may hold several addresses (`a@x.com; b@y.com`), and a path through a list
  gives one per item. Invalid values are skipped and counted in the log; at most
  200 addresses per run.
- **Opting out is always there.** Every e-mail carries an unsubscribe link in the footer and in the
  `List-Unsubscribe` header, and every SMS ends with one. The link opens a public page
  (`/notifications/opt-out/…`) that only acts on a click — mail scanners that open links do not
  unsubscribe anyone —, and the same page undoes it. An address that opted out is skipped from then on;
  it is not a failure, and the step publishes how many in `optedOut`. If the opt-out cannot be
  recorded before sending, nothing is sent.
- **Every send leaves a trace.** One Audit trail entry per address and channel — sent, failed, or
  skipped because it opted out —, with the address and the record, whatever `toAudit` says. Opting
  out and back in are audited too.
- Requires `kernel: "^2.78.0"`. An older kernel ignores the inputs and the field
  declaration, and the step fails for lack of recipients.

### Sharing documents with the portal

A document reaches the portal only when it is **shared** — the same mark a member sets on the
Documents tab, and the one a guest's own upload is born with. An automation sets it two ways
(kernel `^2.70.0`):

- `render-document` with `portalShared: true` attaches the generated file already shared. Only with
  `destination: 'record'` — Downloads is not in the portal — and only on a screen whose `portal`
  declares `documents: true`; either one missing fails the step before anything is generated.
- `share-documents` shares (`shared: true`, the default) or stops sharing (`false`) what a record
  already has — the release "at the right moment": when the order is confirmed, when the guest opens it.
  Without `documentId` it covers every document of the record, narrowed by `documentType`; a
  `documentId` that is not attached to that record fails the step. Documents already in the asked
  state are not written again, so running it twice changes nothing.

```ts
{
  id: 'releaseDocuments',
  stepDefinitionId: 'share-documents',
  type: 'Action',
  order: 0,
  enabled: true,
  configuration: {
    collection: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'orders' },
    recordId: { kind: 'Event', path: 'id' },
    shared: { kind: 'Literal', value: true },
  },
}
```

- **Who sees it** never changes: the portal takes a shared document only to the guests who already
  see its record — the subject, `visibleWhen`, the chain of parents. Sharing a document of a record
  that is not in the portal exposes nothing; it shows up when the record does.
- **The proof.** Each change is an Audit trail entry naming who made it — the member who triggered
  the flow, or the automation itself — and when.
- **Listening to it.** Saving a note or a document of a record publishes
  `<prefix>_note.saved` / `<prefix>_document.saved` (and `.deleted`), where `<prefix>` is the event
  prefix of the record's screen, for every screen that shows the tab (kernel
  `^2.69.0`). The payload is the note or the document, plus `parentId`,
  `parentType` and `parent` (the id and the title field of the record).

### Inviting to the portal

`portal-invite` gives someone from outside access to a record of a `'self'` screen — the SAME invitation
Settings > Portal makes: the same account, the same link to the record, the same list in Settings. It is how
the invitation follows a record you validate, instead of someone typing it in later. `portal-revoke`
takes it back. Both require `kernel: "^2.73.0"`.

```ts
{
  id: 'inviteContact',
  stepDefinitionId: 'portal-invite',
  type: 'Action',
  order: 0,
  enabled: true,
  configuration: {
    subjectCollection: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'clients' },
    subjectRecordId: { kind: 'Event', path: 'client' },
    email: { kind: 'Event', path: 'email' },
    displayName: { kind: 'Event', path: 'name' },
  },
}
```

- **The screen opens the door.** `subjectCollection` must be a screen with
  `portal: { subject: 'self', ..., invites: { automation: true } }` (section 4). Any other fails the step,
  and the package gate refuses an invitation to a screen of your own package that does not declare it.
  Removing access needs no declaration — taking access away never exposes anything.
- **Who triggered the flow does not matter.** No permission of the person who pressed the button is
  asked: the organization decided, in the declaration, that this screen accepts invitations. The person
  — or the automation, when nobody triggered it — is who the Audit trail names.
- **Run it as often as you like.** The same e-mail and record twice is one invitation: nothing is written,
  no second e-mail goes out, and `granted` is `false`. So it is safe on `.saved`.
- **The welcome e-mail** (`sendEmail`, on by default) goes only to whoever was JUST invited, by the
  organization's e-mail, in the organization's language, with the link to the record in the portal; the
  guest signs in there with that address. Without the organization's e-mail set up, the invitation is
  made anyway, `emailed` is `false` and the run's log says why.
- **Limits.** At most 500 NEW invitations per organization per hour, all
  automations together; past it, the step fails with a named error and the run can be repeated later. An
  invalid e-mail fails the step too. A limit of your own — five representatives per company — belongs to
  the record you validate (a key, a rule), so the invitation only follows records that passed it.
- **`portal-revoke`** removes that record from the guest's access at once; with `allSubjects: true`, the
  whole invitation — but only of someone who has that record. Someone without access is `revoked: false`,
  not an error. Revoke on `.deleted` too: a deleted record does not take its guests with it.
- **The proof.** Every new invitation and every removal is an Audit trail entry: who, which record, and
  that it came from an automation.
- **Verified identity.** `requiredClaimName`, `requiredClaimValue` and `requiredClaimNormalize`
  (`digits` or `lowercase`) make it an invitation by IDENTITY: no account is opened for
  the e-mail, and only someone who signs in through one of the organization's identity providers
  proving that claim gets in (section 4). Set the name and the value comes out empty, the step FAILS — it
  never falls back to an e-mail invitation. The claim must be one a provider of the organization
  verifies, or the step fails too. No welcome e-mail goes out (`emailed` is `false`, the log says
  why): the guest's account only exists after the first sign-in. `inviteId` is the invitation, and
  `portal-revoke` by the same e-mail removes it. Requires
  `kernel: "^2.74.0"` — an older kernel would ignore the claim and invite by
  e-mail, so the package gate refuses it.
- **The role.** `role` gives the guest a role on THIS record — the key a screen's `create.when` or an
  action's condition compares in `actor.portalRoles` (section 4). Empty, a new access has no role and an
  existing one keeps its own; filled, the role on the record becomes this one — even when the access
  already existed (`granted: false`, `roleChanged: true`, no welcome e-mail, no slot of the hourly
  limit, an Audit trail entry). To take a role away, revoke the record and invite again without it. A
  value that is not a key fails the step. Requires `kernel: "^2.89.0"`.

```ts
configuration: {
  subjectCollection: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'clients' },
  subjectRecordId: { kind: 'Event', path: 'client' },
  email: { kind: 'Event', path: 'email' },
  requiredClaimName: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'nationalId' },
  requiredClaimValue: { kind: 'Event', path: 'documentNumber' },
  requiredClaimNormalize: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'digits' },
}
```

**What the guest proved travels with what the guest does.** A record saved through the portal carries
`portalVerified` — `{ provider, claim: { name, value } | null, level }`, or `null` when the guest
signed in by e-mail — so a `.saved` workflow, a report or a document template can say who acted and
with what assurance. It is a system field: no workflow, script or screen writes it, and the Audit trail
entry of that write shows it too. In expressions, `actor.verified` has the same shape whenever the
actor is a portal guest who proved an identity, and is `null` otherwise.

### A workflow that runs when a guest opens a record — `portalViewed`

On a screen that declares `portal: { ..., trackViews: true }` (section 4), the server publishes
`<collection>.portalViewed` — with the screen's `eventPrefix` when it has one — each time a guest opens
one of its records in the portal or gets the link of one of its documents:

```ts
{
  templateId: 'wf-notice-read',
  name: label('workflow.notice-read'),
  eventName: 'notices.portalViewed',
  version: 1,
  condition: { kind: 'Expression', expression: 'isEmpty(event.readAt)' },
  steps: [ /* a map + upsert that writes event.portalView.at into a record of yours */ ],
}
```

- **The payload is the record**, at the root, as in `.saved` (no `old`, no `changeType`), plus
  `portalView`: `at` (the server's clock), `email` (the guest's invitation), and `documentId`,
  `documentName`, `documentType` — `null` when it was the record that was opened.
- **The guest is the `actor`**: `actor.via` is `"portal"`, `actor.verified` the identity they proved
  (or `null`), and `hasPermission(...)` answers false. What the workflow writes is written in the
  guest's name — `updatedVia: "portal"`, with `portalVerified`.
- **Once per window.** The same guest opening the same record, or the same document, again within
  30 minutes publishes nothing. Opening the record and opening a document of it are
  different openings. Guard the first one in your condition (`isEmpty(event.readAt)`) when only the
  first counts.
- **Evidence belongs in a record of yours** (section 8, "The audit trail is not your evidence store"): the
  kernel's Audit trail entry expires with the organization's retention; what this workflow writes stays.
- The package gate refuses the trigger on a screen of your own package that does not declare
  `trackViews` — it would never fire —, and requires `kernel: "^2.79.0"`.

### Waiting inside a workflow — the `delay` step

```ts
{ id: 'wait', stepDefinitionId: 'delay', type: 'Action', order: 1, enabled: true,
  configuration: { duration: { kind: 'Literal', value: '2d' } } }   // or { until: <a date> }
```

It pauses the run and continues it later, IN THE SAME RUN: the execution shows "waiting" with the time it
continues, and the steps after it run then, with the outputs and variables from before.

- **`duration`** is `30m`, `4h` or `2d` (up to 365 days); **`until`** is an instant. Exactly one of the two.
  An `until` that has already passed does not wait.
- **Only at the top level** of the workflow — not inside a condition branch or a loop body.
- **Only in a run started by an event** (a save, a date, a schedule, a `call-workflow` that does not wait). A
  run someone is waiting on — an action's button, a `call-workflow` waiting for the result, a test run —
  cannot pause, and the step fails there. `validate_plugin` refuses a `delay` in a workflow one of your
  actions runs.
- **It continues on the workflow as it is THEN.** Turned off, deleted, or its extension deactivated during the
  wait: the run ends "cancelled", saying why. The steps after the wait are those of the current version.
- `actor` comes back as the same person, with no permissions — `hasPermission` answers false after a wait.
- Precision is the clock's: it continues within 5 minutes of the time.

The `delay` step needs kernel 2.34.0 or later, and `validate_plugin` refuses a package that admits an older one.

### A workflow that only exists to be called

`eventName: 'workflow.called'` is the flow with no trigger of its own — the one an **action** fires,
and the one `call-workflow` calls. It is the most used shape there is, and the only one that
declares `parameters`:

```ts
{
  templateId: 'wf-review',
  name: label('workflow.review'),
  eventName: 'workflow.called',
  version: 1,
  condition: { kind: 'AlwaysTrue' },
  parameters: [
    { key: 'recordId', label: label('param.record'), type: 'EntityReference', entityType: 'invoices', required: true },
    {
      key: 'decision', label: label('param.decision'), type: 'select', required: true,
      options: [
        { value: 'approved', label: label('param.approve') },
        { value: 'rejected', label: label('param.reject') },
      ],
    },
    { key: 'note', label: label('param.note'), type: 'String', rules: { validate: { maxLength: 500 } } },
  ],
  steps: [ /* … */ ],
}
```

**The parameters ARE the `event.` of that flow.** When an action fires it, `recordId` is
the record of the button, sent on every run; declare it as an `EntityReference` to the collection and a
condition or an expression reads its fields under `event.` (`event.recordId.status`) — see "What a button reads
back". A bare `recordId.status` is not in scope: the workflow condition fails, counts as false, and
the button reports that the action does not apply to the record. A step reads `decision` as
`{ kind: 'Event', path: 'decision' }`, or as `event.decision` inside an expression — there is no
`payload` level here, because nothing was saved.

`type` is `String`, `Number`, `Date`, `Boolean`, `select`, `lookup`, `EntityReference` or
`Object` (which nests through `fields`). `rules` applies the same formatting and validation a screen
field gets, so the parameter form refuses a bad value before the flow starts rather than halfway
through it: `validate` takes `check` (a preset), `pattern` (with `flags`), `minLength` and
`maxLength` (counted in characters), and an optional `message` that replaces the default refusal.
`list: true` makes it many.

### Actions

An action is a button on a record — on the list card, in the detail header, or inside a parent's tab.

```ts
actions: [{
  templateId: 'act-approve',
  key: 'approve',
  title: label('action.approve'),
  icon: 'check',
  workflowId: 'wf-approve',                       // a templateId in THIS package
  hiddenWhen: 'not hasPermission("<entity>.update")',
  disabledWhen: 'status == "PAID"',
  confirmMessage: label('action.approve.confirm'),
  danger: false,
  enabled: true,
  order: 0,
}]
```

`command` instead of `workflowId` runs one of the platform's own record gestures — present, it wins,
and `workflowId` may be left out (`{ templateId: 'act-copy', key: 'copy', command: 'copyLink', ... }`).
An action with neither is refused by `check`.
The ones the kernel brings are `copyLink`, `clone`, `manageTags`, `delete`, `generateDocument`, `unlink`, and anything contributed to
`ui.record.action` joins them (`microteia://record-commands` on the MCP server answers for this
installation). `order`, `enabled` and `danger` are REQUIRED on every action.
`activeWhen` turns the button into a switch that shows the record's current state.
`promptParameters` opens the workflow's parameter form before firing, and `parameterDefaults` maps
each parameter to an expression, for when the field name on screen is not the parameter name in the
flow — or when the value lives on a record this one points at:

```ts
{
  templateId: 'act-generate-invoice',
  workflowId: 'wf-generate-invoice',
  promptParameters: true,
  parameterDefaults: {
    sellerId: 'orderId.sellerId',   // the seller of the ORDER, not a copy
    orderNumber: 'code',
  },
  // ...
}
```

Each parameter opens with the first of these that answers: the `parameterDefaults` expression; the
record's field with the same key; the parameter's own `defaultValue` in the workflow. A declared
expression that answers empty skips the same-key field — it was declared not to be that field — but
still falls back to `defaultValue`. An expression that throws is reported and the parameter falls
back as if it had none.

A screen offers the action by putting its `templateId` in `cardActionIds` or `viewActionIds`.

### What a button sends, and what it reads back

**What it sends.** Every run of an action's flow receives `action`, `source`, `context`, `recordId`, `isNew`,
filled by the platform — never by the form, never by `parameterDefaults`. `recordId` is the
record of the button. Every OTHER parameter of the flow reaches it only through the form
`promptParameters` opens: `parameterDefaults` pre-fills that form, and an action without
`promptParameters` never evaluates it. So a flow that needs the record declares `recordId`
(`type: 'EntityReference'`, `entityType` = the collection) — not `invoiceId` mapped from `id`, which arrives
empty the moment the form is not opened, and takes the flow's condition down with it. A required
parameter the button cannot send refuses the run before the first step. `check` warns about both.

**What it reads back.** The button takes the outputs of the LAST step that runs and looks for
`result`, `status`, `actions`. With none of them the whole flow still runs — it writes,
notifies, audits — and the button reports that nothing came back. The step that answers is a `map`
with **no `name`**, which publishes its fields at the root; a named `map` publishes `{ <name>: {...} }` and
the button finds nothing.

```ts
{
  id: 'answer', stepDefinitionId: 'map', type: 'Action', order: 9, enabled: true,
  configuration: {
    map: {
      kind: 'Literal',
      value: {
        fields: [
          { name: 'status', value: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'SUCCESS' } },
          { name: 'actions', value: { kind: 'Literal', value: ['refresh'] } },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- `status` is `"SUCCESS"`, `"WARNING"`, `"ERROR"` — as text (`"SUCCESS"`), as a pair
  `["ERROR", "message"]` (the form an Expression can build), or as an object
  `{ code, message, fieldErrors }`. Text that is not a code becomes the message of a `SUCCESS`. With
  `ERROR` the screen shows the message and applies none of the `actions`.
- `actions` is a list of what the screen does next, applied in this order whatever order you write:
  `replace`, `merge`, `save`, `refresh`, `clone`, `delete`, `close`.
- `result` is an object the screen merges into (`merge`) or puts in place of (`replace`) the values on
  screen.

**Every path answers.** A `Condition` that refuses returns `status: ["ERROR", "<why>"]` in a `map` and THEN
`exit`s — `exit` has no output of its own and keeps the step before it as the answer; an `exit` with
nothing before it answers nothing. A false workflow `condition` does not run the flow at all: the
button reports that the action does not apply to this record, in the platform's words — a refusal that
must say WHY belongs inside the flow, as a `map` with `ERROR`.
`check` follows every path of the flow an action fires and warns about each one that ends without an
answer, naming the step; a `script` or a called flow at the end is not judged — only the run knows what
they return.

### Scripts

A script is TypeScript with **no `import`, `export` or `require`**, running in a QuickJS sandbox on
the server. The convention is a `main` that returns the outputs:

```ts
async function main() {
  const open = await query({
    table: 'invoices',
    where: [{ path: 'status', op: 'eq', value: 'OPEN' }],   // 'eq', never '=='
    orderBy: [{ path: 'dueDate', dir: 'asc' }],
    limit: 50,
    projections: ['id', 'total'],
  });
  for (const invoice of open.results) {                       // { count, results, first }, never an array
    await upsert({ table: 'invoices', id: String(invoice.id), data: { status: 'PAID' } });
  }
  log('closed', open.count);
  return { closed: open.count };
}

main();
```

`upsert({ table, data, matchPrimaryKey: true })` with no `id` updates the record holding the same
`primary` key instead of being refused as a duplicate (see "A primary key as an address" in §8).

In scope: `input` (the declared `inputParams`), `actor` (as in §9 — `{ id, name, via }` or `null`),
`query`, `upsert`, `remove`, `fn.*` (the expression functions of §9), `log` and `console`. Nothing else — no `fetch`, no `require`, no filesystem. The
budget per run is **25 queries, 25 mutations and 10 seconds**; a script that needs more than that is a
Cloud Function (§14), not a script.

Keep each script in a file of its own — `<name>.script.ts`, or `<name>.migration.ts` for a
migration — and bring it into `plugin.ts` with `?raw`, as a view is. `tsc` checks it against
`microteia-sandbox.d.ts`, which declares exactly the globals above: a misspelled `query` field, or
`query()` read as an array, is a red line in the editor and not a failed run on the server.

**Reading a record by its id** is a filter on `id`, in `query()` and in the `query` step alike:
`where: [{ path: 'id', op: 'eq', value: someId }]` for one, `op: 'in'` with a list for several. It reads
those documents directly — no scan, no index, no 300-record ceiling — and any other filter in the same
`where` is checked against what was read. An id that does not exist is simply absent from `results`.

**A script travels with both `sourceTs` and `compiledJs`,** and the compiler does not fill the second
in for you: the sandbox never transpiles, on purpose. Produce it with the same transpiler the platform
uses — `sucrase` is already a devDependency of this workspace:

```ts
import { transpileScriptSource } from '@microteia/sdk/node';

const source = /* your script, from a `?raw` import or a real file */;
const compiled = transpileScriptSource(source);
if ('error' in compiled) throw new Error(compiled.error);

scripts: [{
  templateId: 'scr-close-invoices',
  name: label('script.close'),
  sourceTs: source,
  compiledJs: compiled.compiledJs,
  inputParams: [], outputParams: [{ key: 'closed', label: label('script.closed'), type: 'Number' }],
}]
```

Declaring `outputParams` is what lets later steps read the result by name.

## 11. Reports — questions asked of the data

A report is not a screen and not an automation: it is a **question**. What it covers, how it is
folded, what is counted. Declare one in `reports` and it shows up in the organization's report list
the moment your extension is installed.

```ts
reports: [{
  templateId: 'invoicesByStatus',
  key: 'acme-invoices-by-status',
  title: label('report.invoices'),
  description: label('report.invoices.about'),
  icon: 'fileChart',
  origin: 'plugin',
  spec: {
    v: 1,
    dataset: {
      table: 'invoices',                       // the COLLECTION — a screen your package installs
      where: [{ path: 'status', op: 'neq', value: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'void' } }],
      dimensions: [
        { key: 'month', path: 'dueDate', label: label('report.month'), granularity: 'month',
          timeZone: 'America/Sao_Paulo' },
        { key: 'city', path: 'client.city', label: label('report.city'), sort: { dir: 'asc' } },
      ],
      measures: [
        { key: 'total', op: 'sum', path: 'amount', label: label('report.total'),
          format: { kind: 'currency' } },
        { key: 'count', op: 'count', label: label('report.count') },
        { key: 'late', op: 'sum', path: 'amount', label: label('report.late'),
          filter: [{ path: 'status', op: 'eq', value: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'overdue' } }] },
      ],
    },
    shape: {
      kind: 'matrix',
      rows: [{ dimension: 'city', subtotal: true }],
      columns: [{ dimension: 'month' }],
      values: ['total', 'count'],
      emptyCell: 'blank',
    },
    presentation: {
      chart: { kind: 'bar', category: 'month', series: ['total'], splitBy: 'city', stacked: true },
      prompts: [{ key: 'city', label: label('report.ask.city'), path: 'client.city', op: 'eq' }],
      export: { csv: true },
    },
  },
}]
```

Call `describe_sdk_type ReportSpec` for the exact shape of the spec and
`describe_sdk_type ReportModuleTemplate` for the envelope around it — both expand the types they
reference. `list_report_options` (`microteia://reports/options`) answers the other half: the folds,
the chart kinds, the date buckets, the measure operations and the capability tokens THIS installation
executes, derived from the kernel rather than from this page.

The fold above is a pivot. The one that answers "WHAT each customer owes" — the records, gathered,
with the total of each group — is a list that groups. Its columns are DIMENSIONS, so the record's own
values are declared as dimensions of the dataset:

```ts
dataset: {
  table: 'invoices',
  dimensions: [
    { key: 'number', path: 'number', label: label('report.number') },
    { key: 'dueDate', path: 'dueDate', label: label('report.due') },
    { key: 'amount', path: 'amount', label: label('report.amount') },
    { key: 'city', path: 'client.city', label: label('report.city') },
  ],
  measures: [{ key: 'total', op: 'sum', path: 'amount', label: label('report.total') }],
},
shape: {
  kind: 'tabular',
  columns: ['number', 'dueDate', 'amount'],   // dimension keys — never a measure key
  groupBy: [{ dimension: 'city', subtotal: true }],
}
```

### The envelope

| property | what it is |
|---|---|
| `templateId` | the stable address of the report inside your package, as with every other artifact |
| `key` | how it is ADDRESSED once installed: its tab (`rep:<key>`), its deep link, the command palette, and the `report` node of the Widget DSL (§6). Unlike a collection name it is **not** rewritten on installation — prefix it with your extension |
| `origin` | `'plugin'`, always, for a report your package brings |
| `icon` | one key of the icon catalogue (§4) |
| `enabled` | `false` installs it hidden: declared, not offered |
| `spec` | the report itself — everything below |

A report your package brings is **managed**: its spec is read-only in the organization's designer, and
the gesture there is to duplicate it. That is not borrowed from how screens behave, it is the opposite
of it, and on purpose: a screen merges because a field is an independent unit with an owner of its
own, while a report is a single assertion — half of your package plus half of somebody's edit is a
number nobody wrote.

### Three layers, and why the split is the contract

`dataset` is the **semantic layer**: where the rows come from, what can be grouped
(`dimensions`) and what can be measured (`measures`). `shape` is the **fold**. `presentation`
is the **look**.

`shape` and `presentation` never repeat a path — they **cite a key**. That indirection is what
buys you years: swapping the measured field, changing the period, promoting a measure to a computed
one, are all a change inside one `dataset` entry, and nothing else moves.

The split is also what decides how an OLDER kernel treats your report:

| Where the unknown thing is | What happens |
|---|---|
| `presentation` | ignored, the rest renders |
| `shape`, `dimension.granularity` | degrades to the documented fallback, **with a visible warning** |
| `dataset`, `measures` | the report is **refused**, naming the token |

That asymmetry is deliberate. A discarded chart shows *less*; a discarded measure shows **a
different number under the same label**, and no reader can notice that. So write the numbers you
mean, and treat a refusal as the platform telling you it cannot answer for them.

### The vocabulary

- `measures[].op`: `sum`, `count`, `avg`, `min`, `max` — the same words a field aggregate uses, minus `latest`, which copies a value instead of computing a number. `path` is required except for `count`; `count` with `distinct: true` and a `path`
  counts distinct values. `filter` restricts one measure and only it — that is how one column counts
  everything and the next counts only what is overdue, in the same table.
- `measures[].kind: 'computed'` with an `expression` over OTHER measures of the same report, by key
  — `won / count * 100`, `total / quantity`. It is evaluated AFTER aggregation, on every row,
  subtotal, pivot cell and total, so a ratio is the ratio of that group's totals and never the average
  of per-record ratios. It sees measures only, never the record; a measure it cites does not have to
  be in `values`. A cited measure with no value, a division by zero or a non-numeric result leave
  the cell empty instead of inventing a number. Citing a name that is not a measure, or a cycle
  between computed measures, refuses the report.
- `measures[].format`: `{ kind, decimals, preset }`. `kind` is `number`, `integer`,
  `currency`, `percent`, `date` or `duration`; `preset` names an entry of the SAME field-rule
  preset catalogue a field uses, never a parallel one. `percent` prints the number as it is,
  followed by `%` — a ratio has to be multiplied by 100 in its expression.
- `dimensions[].granularity`: `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`. Only meaningful over a date. **Set `timeZone`**: without it the bucket is cut in UTC, and a sale at nine at night
  on the 31st lands in the wrong month — with nothing on screen saying so.
- `dimensions[].path` may cross a reference (`client.city`), same grammar as a query projection.
- `dimensions[].sort`: `{ dir: 'asc' | 'desc' }` orders that level's members. `limit` keeps the
  first N of them, and what it drops does not reappear anywhere — while the grand total still counts
  every row scanned. So a limited level marks the result **partial**, and the platform says so on
  screen, in the CSV and on the printed page, because rows that do not add up to their own total are
  the one thing a reader cannot catch.
- `shape.kind`: `tabular`, `summary`, `matrix`. **Grouping and showing are two different
  questions, and the fold decides how the second one is answered — never whether the first one was
  asked.** Every fold groups by `{ dimension, subtotal? }` levels, outermost first; what changes is
  what the fold does with the levels and with the dimensions that are NOT levels:

  | fold | one row is | the levels are | the other dimensions |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `tabular` | a RECORD | `groupBy`, optional | `columns` |
  | `summary` | a GROUP | `groupBy`, required | shown nowhere — you are warned by key |
  | `matrix` | a group × a column | `rows` (and `columns`) | shown nowhere — you are warned by key |

  - `tabular`: one row per record. `columns` is an array of **dimension keys**, plain strings, in
    column order — a measure key there is a named error. `orderBy` is done by the query.
    `groupBy` breaks the list into groups **without giving up the columns**: each group opens with
    the value of its dimension, its records follow with the same columns as always, and the group's
    total closes it. That is the report that answers "WHAT each customer owes"; `summary` answers
    "HOW MUCH", and the difference is whether the records survive. Put a dimension in `groupBy` and
    leave it OUT of `columns` — repeating it on every detail line writes the same value under the
    band that just said it.
  - `summary`: `groupBy` is required and `values` is an array of measure keys. The records do
    not appear at all — only one row per group, with its numbers. A `summary` with an empty
    `groupBy` is refused: there would be nothing to group, and it would render as "no data" over a
    full collection.
  - `matrix`: `rows` and `columns` are those same level objects and BOTH are required. This
    version reads one level of `columns`; more than one is flattened, with a warning.
    `emptyCell: 'zero'` writes a zero where nothing happened — the default leaves it blank, because
    "there was none" and "there was, and it came to zero" are different statements.
  - `grandTotal: false` drops the total row, on `summary` and `matrix`.
  - **Declare only the dimensions the fold uses.** One that is neither a level nor a column is shown
    nowhere, and the platform warns whoever opens the report, naming it. It is a warning and not a
    refusal because the numbers stay right — but a field that silently vanishes reads as lost data.
- `presentation.chart.kind`: `bar`, `column`, `line`, `area`, `pie`, `donut`. `category` is the dimension on the
  categorical axis, `series` the measures drawn (absent: all of `values`), `splitBy` a second
  dimension that breaks each measure into one series per member — the pivot's columns becoming the
  legend — and `stacked` piles them instead of setting them side by side. A kind this version cannot
  draw simply does not appear; the table still shows the same data.

  **`splitBy` names a level the fold already has.** Either the grouping level right below the one on
  the axis — `groupBy: [month, city]` with `category: 'month'`, `splitBy: 'city'` — or, on a
  `matrix`, the other side of the pivot: a column grouping when the axis is a row level, a row level
  when the axis is the columns (the example above, and the pivot's default axis). Every bar is then
  one row or one cell the fold already computed, so an average stays an average. In a `summary` or a `matrix`, a level that is not the last needs
  `subtotal: true` to have rows at all. A pie or a donut draws one figure and ignores `splitBy`.
  Anything else is warned by key and the chart is drawn without the breakdown — the platform never
  adds rows up to make one.

  **A chart plots GROUPS, so the fold has to have them.** It reads one level of `groupBy` /
  `rows` — the one `category` names, or the innermost when it names none — and one point comes out
  of each member of that level, with the measures of that group as its values. So a `summary`, a
  `matrix` and a `tabular` **with** `groupBy` all draw; a `tabular` with no grouping does not,
  and declaring a chart on one is warned rather than rendered as an empty frame beside a full table.
  If you want the chart, group the list — you keep the records either way.
- `dataset.scanLimit` asks for a smaller scan than the ceiling. Asking for a bigger one is clamped,
  never refused.

### The question the report asks the reader

`presentation.prompts` is the filter the READER fills in before running — the difference between one
report and the same report per customer, per period, per city.

```ts
prompts: [
  { key: 'from', label: label('report.ask.from'), path: 'dueDate', op: 'gte' },
  { key: 'customer', label: label('report.ask.customer'), path: 'customerId', op: 'in' },
]
```

Each prompt names a `path` and an `op`, and an answered one becomes one more predicate on top of
`dataset.where`. How it is asked comes from the FIELD the path points at — a date asks with a date
picker, a reference asks with the record chooser of the collection it points to, an option list asks
with its options. You do not choose that, and you should not try to: it is the same control the
organization already knows from the screen the data came from.

**A prompt left empty simply does not filter.** `required` and `default` are in the contract and
this version acts on neither, so a report that would be wrong unrestricted needs its restriction in
`dataset.where`, where nobody can skip it.

### The question asked of each row

`dataset.where` compares one path with one value, and that is what makes it cheap: an equality goes
down to the database. `dataset.includeWhen` is the other half — an EXPRESSION (§9), evaluated over
each row, and the row enters the report when it answers true.

```ts
dataset: {
  table: 'invoices',
  where: [{ path: 'status', op: 'neq', value: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'void' } }],
  includeWhen: 'paid < amount and dueDate < today()',
}
```

Reach for it when no list of predicates can write the question: two fields compared with each other,
an arithmetic check, a date read against today, an OR between two ANDs. The scope is the row — the
fields at the root, a reference navigated by the name of the record it points at (`client.city`), and
`id`. Compare a reference through the record it points at (`client.id`), never through the raw path:
the row arrives with the pointed record in place of the id, so comparing the raw path with an id finds
nothing.

Three properties follow from where it runs, and each one matters:

- **It only narrows.** It is evaluated in memory over what the scan brought back, so it never widens
  the read and the scan ceiling keeps its meaning. Keep the cheap part of the question in
  `where` — that is the part the database answers.
- **Every path it names is read data.** It joins the hydration plan and the permission check like any
  other path, so `client.city` in an expression asks for the read of the pointed collection exactly
  as grouping by it would.
- **An expression that cannot be answered refuses the report.** Not the row — the report. This is the
  one place where swallowing a failure produces a SMALLER total under the same label, and no reader can
  catch that. A path the record has no value for is not a failure: it is `null`.

It lives in `dataset`, so an older kernel that does not execute it **refuses** the report by the name
of the token (`dataset.includeWhen`) rather than summing the rows it would have excluded.

### What is refused, and what is only warned about

The same function checks a report before it is packaged, before it is saved and before it runs — there
is no path where one accepts what another rejects. It is **refused** when:

- it declares no measure. A report with no number has nothing to say, a `tabular` one included;
- `shape` cites a dimension or measure key that `dataset` does not declare, or a `tabular` column
  that is a measure;
- a `summary` groups by nothing, or a `tabular` is left with no column at all — including the case
  where every dimension it declares went into `groupBy`, which the refusal names separately, because
  "add a column" has nothing to teach whoever grouped by the only field they had;
- a `matrix` is missing its rows or its columns;
- two keys collide — dimensions and measures share ONE namespace, so that `values` can never be
  ambiguous;
- a measure other than `count` has no `path`;
- `dataset.includeWhen` is not a valid expression, or names a path the schema cannot walk;
- `dataset.table` is not a collection this installation has.

Everything else is a **warning**, and warnings are visible — to you in `validate_plugin`, and to
whoever opens the report. A chart citing a key nobody declared, a chart on a list that groups by
nothing, a dimension the fold shows nowhere, a bucket over something that is not a date, a scan above
the ceiling, and every property this version reads but does not act on, all arrive that way rather
than as silence.

**A path no field declares is accepted** — by design. In an installation it may be a field the
organization created in the Form Design, and refusing it would break the report they built. So a typo
(`responsibleId.nmae`) installs, runs, and comes out as an empty column. `check` and `validate_plugin`
close that gap from where they stand: every path of your reports and of your `query` steps is walked
against the screens this directory sees — your own, the `plugin.ts` files beside it and the
`installed-catalog.json`, the same sources that resolve an event prefix — and one that leaves the schema
on a collection whose screen is in view is a **warning**, naming the collection and the field. A
collection with no visible screen is not checked.

### What you do not control, and should not try to

**Permission.** Running a report charges, on the server, the read permission of every collection it
touches — including collections reached through a reference. Grouping by `client.city` requires
`clients.read`. You do not declare that and cannot opt out of it: the list is derived from the
hydration plan, so a package cannot hide a hop by declaring less.

A report may carry a permission of its OWN — `spec.access.permission`, with `requires` for what it
depends on (§13). It only ever restricts: seeing the report takes that permission AND the read of
every collection it touches. It cannot grant, and that is the whole reason creating a report is
allowed to be cheap.

**The scan ceiling.** The query is index-free by design, so it walks documents with a ceiling. A
report covering more than that comes back marked partial, and the platform says so on screen, in the
CSV header and on the printed page. Do not work around it — a partial number presented as a total is
the one failure a reader cannot catch.

**The collection name.** `dataset.table` is the `key` of a screen your package installs, and the
installation rewrites it: an organization that already had that screen, with the same `sourceId`, keeps
its own key. Paths
are NOT rewritten, because a path never names a collection. Point at a collection your package
carries, or one a declared dependency brings — the package gate refuses anything else.

**`requires`.** Derived from the spec, never written by hand. It is what lets a kernel refuse your
report by the NAME of the feature it lacks instead of running it without that feature and returning a
different number under the same label. Leaving it out is correct; writing it short is the one way to
defeat that gate, so the package gate refuses a `requires` that omits anything the spec uses.

### Putting one somewhere other than the report list

A report is a page of its own, and it is also a node: `{ type: 'report', report: '<key>' }` places it
in any Widget DSL tree (§6). A `grid` of those nodes is a dashboard — declared, with no code in it
and nothing for anybody to review.

### Writing a report in code

When the declared shape is not enough — a cover page, text between sections, two datasets side by
side — write a view and compose `@microteia/report`: `useReport`, `ReportView`,
`ReportTable`, `ReportMatrix`, `ReportChart`. They are the same components the platform uses,
so this is composition, not reimplementation.

The report still needs its `dataset`: code replaces the **presentation**, never the data. Numbers
arrive through `useReport`, which asks the server — and that is where permission is charged. A view
is `impl: { kind: 'code' }`, so it waits for an administrator to read and trust it (§7).

### What the contract names but this version does not run

`schedule` (running on a timer) and `dataset.kind: 'join'`. Declaring one is not silently ignored: the platform refuses the report by
the name of what it lacks.

These are read and not acted on, and each says so as a warning rather than doing nothing:
`shape.limit`, `presentation.fields`, `presentation.drillDown`, `presentation.export.fileName`
(the file is always offered, and its name comes from the title), `prompts[].control`,
`prompts[].required`, `prompts[].default`, and `dimensions[].sort.by` — of `sort`, only
`dir` is read, and members are ordered by their key.

Reading any of this here is how you know it is coming, not permission to use it yet.

## 12. Documents — templates generated from a record

A document template — a power of attorney, a fee agreement, a receipt, a notice — is **data**: a
`document.template` contribution, no code, no trust gesture. The organization generates it from the
record (the "Generate document" gesture) or from an automation (the `render-document` step), and the
file lands in that record's Documents tab or in Downloads. Requires kernel `^2.36.0`.

```ts
import { documentTemplateContribution } from '@microteia/sdk';

contributes: [
  documentTemplateContribution({
    key: 'acme-payment-plan',               // the address; the organization's template on the same key wins
    title: label('template.payment-plan'),  // a message reference, like every label
    collection: 'acmeAgreement',            // the screen key as you declared it...
    screenSourceId: 'acme:agreement',       // ...and its sourceId, which wins: an adopted screen keeps the office's key
    format: 'markdown',
    body: PAYMENT_PLAN,                      // the text below
    fileName: 'Payment plan - {{party}}',
    datasets: [{ name: 'installments', from: 'acmeInstallment', fromSourceId: 'acme:installment',
                 via: 'agreement', orderBy: 'dueDate' }],
  }),
],
```

Where the file goes is the template's default, and whoever generates it may ask for the other:

- `destination: 'record'` (the default) attaches it to the record's Documents tab. The screen must
  declare `hasDocuments: true` — without the tab there is nowhere to attach the file, and the generation
  refuses instead of sending it elsewhere.
- `destination: 'downloads'` saves it to the organization's Downloads, a temporary area that needs no
  tab: a receipt to hand over, a statement to send. `retentionDays` (0 to 365, 0 = never
  expires) overrides the organization's retention setting; past it, the file is deleted.

Both fields require kernel `^2.47.0`; an older kernel ignores them and attaches.

The `render-document` step can also attach the file **already shared with the portal**
(`portalShared: true`) — see "Sharing documents with the portal" in section 10.

### Templates of data — `source: 'payload'`

Not every document is about a record. A template with `source: 'payload'` has no screen: whoever
generates it — an automation, an AI agent — sends the data, and the paths start at that object. It
goes to Downloads unless whoever generates it says which record owns it (`belongsTo`, below), and
generating it needs the `documents.generate` permission.

```ts
documentTemplateContribution({
  key: 'acme-quote',
  title: label('template.quote'),
  source: 'payload',
  collection: '',                           // no screen
  format: 'markdown',
  body: QUOTE,                              // {{customer.name}}, {{#each lines}}…{{/each}}
  parameters: [
    { key: 'customer', label: 'Customer', type: 'EntityReference', entityType: 'acmeCustomer', required: true },
    { key: 'lines', label: 'Lines', type: 'Object', list: true, fields: [
      { key: 'description', label: 'Description', type: 'String', required: true },
      { key: 'amount', label: 'Amount', type: 'Number' },
    ] },
  ],
  sample: { customer: '', lines: [{ description: 'Setup', amount: 100 }] },
}),
```

- `parameters` are the parameters of a called automation — types `String`, `Number`, `Date`, `Boolean`, `select`, `lookup`, `EntityReference`, `Object`,
  `Object` + `fields` for nesting, `list` for collections, `required` and `rules`. A missing
  required parameter refuses the generation; without parameters any object is accepted as it comes.
- A first-level `EntityReference` takes the record id and is hydrated like a reference field:
  `{{customer.name}}` reads the record. Reading it charges `<collection>.read` of whoever generates.
- No `datasets` and no `destination: 'record'` in the template — it has no record of its own. The
  payload is at most 256 KB of JSON. `sample` is what the preview merges.
- The `render-document` step offers each parameter as its own input (`param.<key>`), plus a `payload`
  input for a whole object.

**Where the file lives — `belongsTo`.** A document with sources almost always has a record it
belongs to, and the same template may be generated from more than one screen. So the home is decided
by **whoever generates**, not by the template: the `render-document` step (and the agent's
`render_document`) takes `belongsTo`, the key of one of the template's single `EntityReference`
parameters.

```ts
configuration: {
  templateKey: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'acme-quote' },
  'param.customer': { kind: 'Event', path: 'customerId' },
  belongsTo: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'customer' },     // the parameter whose record owns the file
  destination: { kind: 'Literal', value: 'record' },     // attach it to that record's Documents tab
},
```

- With `destination: 'record'` the file is attached to that record. Its screen must have the Documents
  tab, and an agent or a person generating needs `<collection>.update` on it — the same as attaching.
- With Downloads, that record is remembered as the file's **origin**, and "Attach to a record" suggests
  it: the copy that goes out to be signed comes back to the right place. Without `belongsTo`, the first
  filled single reference is the suggested origin — and only that: attaching never guesses.
- A list reference, an empty one, or a key that is not a reference is refused, and so is
  `belongsTo` on a record template, whose document already belongs to its record.

`belongsTo` requires kernel `^2.49.0`.

Requires kernel `^2.48.0`; an older kernel finds no screen and drops the template.

### The step is checked against the template

The `param.<key>` inputs of `render-document` are not in the step catalog: they come from the template.
When `templateKey` is a `Literal`, `check` and `validate_plugin` find that template and hold the step
to it — the same rules the step editor and the engine apply, so a typo stops being a blank field in a
document generated at the organization:

1. every `param.<key>` is a parameter of the template — the first segment: `param.customer.name` fills
   `customer`. A payload template without `parameters` accepts any key, and none is checked;
2. `recordId` only on a record template, which needs it; `payload`, `belongsTo` and `param.*` only on
   a payload template;
3. `belongsTo` names a single `EntityReference` parameter (no `list`), and `destination: 'record'` on a
   payload template needs it;
4. every `required` parameter is filled — by `param.<key>`, or by `payload`, whose content is only known
   when the step runs.

Where the template is found decides what the answer means:

| The template is… | The answer |
|---|---|
| in your package | refused, here and on install |
| in another `plugin.ts` of this directory, or in an installed extension of `installed-catalog.json` | refused by `check` / `validate_plugin`, saying where it was read |
| nowhere visible | a warning, never a refusal — the organization may have its own template on that key |

A `templateKey` that only exists at run time (an expression, the output of a step) is not checked.

### The grammar

What sits between `{{ }}` is a **field expression** (§9): the same paths (`{{agreement.party.name}}`
follows references), the same functions (`formatDate`, `formatMoney`, `upper`, `round`…). The
grammar adds only what an expression cannot say: `{{#each …}}…{{/each}}` and `{{#if …}}…{{/if}}`.

```md
# Payment plan

**Party:** {{party}} — signed on {{formatDate(signedOn, "DD/MM/YYYY")}}

| # | Due | Amount |
|---|---|--:|
{{#each installments}}| {{index}} | {{formatDate(dueDate, "DD/MM/YYYY")}} | {{formatMoney(amount)}}{{#if paid}} (paid){{/if}} |
{{/each}}

<!-- pagebreak -->
```

- Inside a loop the item's fields are at the root, the record's are still readable, and `item` and `index`
  are reserved: `item` is the whole element (the only way to read a list of plain texts), `index` the
  position counting from 1.
- There is no `else`: write the opposite condition, `{{#if not paid}}`. A Word template is rendered by a
  different engine, and what one format cannot say the other does not offer.
- A reference alone (`{{client}}`) prints nothing — it is a whole record. Write the field you mean:
  `{{client.name}}`.
- A merged value is **text**, never markup: a party called `A*B` does not open bold.
- `#` is the document title (centered), paragraphs are justified, and GitHub tables, lists, bold,
  italics and `---` work. `<!-- pagebreak -->` starts a new page.
- An expression that fails leaves its place **empty** and the generation reports it — the step
  publishes `emptyFields`. A malformed block is refused by `documentTemplateIssues`, which is what the
  package gate runs.
- Formatting functions without a locale argument speak the **organization's** language and time zone,
  not the language of whoever pressed the button: the document is theirs.

### Lists of child records — `datasets`

A loop repeats a list. A list field of the record works as is; records of ANOTHER screen that point
here come from `datasets`, in the vocabulary of an aggregated field: `from` (the child screen), `via`
(its reference field to this record), `orderBy`, `limit` (at most 100 — more than that is a report,
§11). Address `from` by `fromSourceId` for the same reason as the screen.

`orderBy` is one field with `direction` (`orderBy: 'dueDate', direction: 'desc'`), or a list of keys in the
form of an aggregation's `orderBy` — the first decides, the next break ties:

```ts
datasets: [{ name: 'shipments', from: 'shipment', fromSourceId: SHIPMENT_SOURCE, via: 'order',
  orderBy: [{ path: 'date', dir: 'desc' }, { path: 'time', dir: 'desc' }], limit: 30 }]
```

Use the list whenever the day and the time live in separate fields: ordering by the day alone leaves
the records of one day in whatever order the database returns them, and with `limit` that order
decides WHICH records make it into the document. Both forms end in the same fixed tie-break as
`latest`: an empty key sorts last in both directions, then `createdAt` in the direction of the last
key, then the document id. Each key is a field of the `from` screen (or `createdAt` / `updatedAt`),
and `validate_plugin` checks it when that screen comes in your package. `direction` does not go
with the list — each key carries its own `dir`.
The list of keys requires kernel `^2.58.0`; an older kernel would read it as a field name.

### Formats

| Template | Produces |
|---|---|
| `markdown` | `pdf`, `docx` |
| `docx` | `docx` |

A Word template carries the `.docx` in base64 (`content`, at most 512 KB
decoded) and the fields are written inside the document itself, with the same grammar. Converting Word
to PDF needs an office engine the platform does not run, so that pair is refused when you declare it,
not when someone generates.

### Who wins

1. Among packages, the first contribution of a key in registry order (priority, then plugin id).
2. The organization's own template on the same key replaces yours — "Customize" copies yours there,
   and deleting the copy brings yours back.
3. The organization can turn a key off without uninstalling you.

Your template is never copied into the organization: it lives while your extension is installed and
enabled, and an update replaces it. A template whose screen is not installed is simply not offered.

The example `document-example` is all of the above in one package.

## 13. Access — declare capabilities, never roles

Your extension declares what people can *do*; the organization decides *who* does it. You never see
a role, and that is the point: the profiles of the organization that installs you are theirs to
invent, and your code keeps working when they invent another one.

Every screen collection you install gets four permissions for free:
`<collection>.read`, `.create`, `.update`, `.delete` — and the three writing ones already depend on
`read`. A screen with `memberVisibility` and no `bypassPermission` gets a fifth,
`<collection>.read-all`, which lets a member read the records that do not name them (§8,
"Record visibility"). Declare a permission only for a capability that is not one of those, or to add a
dependency:

```ts
import { accessPermissionContribution } from '@microteia/sdk';

contributes: [
  accessPermissionContribution({
    id: 'invoices.approve',
    name: label('perm.approve'),
    description: label('perm.approve.description'),
    requires: ['invoices.update', 'people.read'],
  }),
]
```

`requires` is the whole trick. When an administrator ticks *Approve*, the platform resolves the
closure and grants what it needs — they never learn the dependency exists. Change the list in a later
version and every profile follows, because a profile stores only what was ticked.

**Adding a dependency to someone else's permission.** Declaring a permission also names it, so only
one package may declare a given id — the second is refused. That leaves out the common case: you
`screenPatch` a screen another extension installed, and the field you added cannot be read without
reading the collection it points at. The permission you would have to change is not yours, and it was
probably never declared at all — a screen collection's four permissions are derived.

`accessRequirementContribution` is the additive form. It carries no name, replaces nothing, reaches a derived
permission, and several packages may add to the same id — the closure is the union:

```ts
import { accessRequirementContribution } from '@microteia/sdk';

contributes: [
  // whoever can read the calendar can now read the order the patched field points at
  accessRequirementContribution({ id: 'calendar.read', requires: ['orders.read'] }),
]
```

An addition that cannot be resolved — the target does not exist, the dependency does not exist, or it
would close a cycle — is **dropped**, with a diagnostic, and the permission goes on working as it did
before you were installed. That is deliberate: an addition only ever widens what is granted, so
dropping one can only narrow, and no extension can lock another one's screen by being installed.

**Asking.** In a screen you wrote, `useCan()` from `@microteia/data`:

```tsx
const can = useCan();
{can('invoices.approve') && <Button onClick={approve}>{t('approve')}</Button>}
```

In anything declarative, `hasPermission(...)` — the patterns are in §9.

### Two-step verification is the organization's rule, not yours

An organization can require a code from an authenticator app, besides the password or the sign-in
provider, from every member or from whoever holds certain profiles or **permissions** (Organization >
Security, for whoever has `mfa.manage`). A package cannot turn it on, require it, or read whether a
person proved it — and does not need to: the platform refuses every read and write of a member who must
use it and whose session has not proved it, and refuses writes once the proof is older than the interval
the organization chose. Your screens and functions see the same refusals they see for a missing
permission.

What it means for what you declare:

- **Give a capability with legal effect a permission of its own.** "Issue a notice", "sign", "approve a
  payment" — if it is only `<collection>.create`, the organization can require the second step only from
  everyone who creates records there. Declared as `notices.issue`, it is the permission the organization
  points the rule at, and nobody else is bothered.
- **Pass the callable's whole `request` along.** `requireInstalledExtension(pluginId, tenantId, request)`
  reads the session's claims from `request.auth.token`. A hand-built `{ auth: { uid } }` has none, and
  is refused for every member the rule reaches.
- **Let the platform ask for your permission.** A callable that requires `notices.issue` passes it to
  `requireInstalledExtension(..., { permission: 'notices.issue' })` (§14), which checks the second step
  with it. Reading the member document yourself checks neither.

## 14. When your extension needs the server

`manifest.backend` declares what the organization's Firebase project must provide — Cloud Functions,
composite indexes, configuration parameters, manual prerequisites. The extension stays **pending**,
and does not load, until an administrator runs `microteia provision`. Failing closed is deliberate: a
menu whose backend is missing produces the most expensive kind of defect, where the app opens and
every call fails looking like something else entirely.

### You can write those functions yourself

Put them in `<folder>/functions/`, read through its `index.ts`, and name each one in
`manifest.backend.functions`. Then they behave exactly like the platform's own: deployed only where
the extension is installed, removed by `microteia provision --prune` when nothing needs them.

    npx microteia-plugin create function --plugin <folder>

| What it needs | Where you declare it |
|---|---|
| an npm package the platform does not carry | `dependencies` in `<folder>/functions/package.json` |
| a credential or setting | `defineString('NAME')`, and `'NAME'` in `manifest.backend.parameters` |
| something a person must do by hand first | `manifest.backend.prerequisites` |
| a composite index your queries need | `manifest.backend.indexes` |

A view calls one through `@microteia/functions`; ask `describe_host_module` for the shape.

### They travel inside your package — and someone approves them

`microteia-plugin build` bundles `<folder>/functions/` into the `.json` as `backendSource`: every
`.ts` and `.json` file, without tests, `node_modules` or hidden files, plus a SHA-256 of the whole. An
organization that installs your package from a file or from the catalogue gets the code with it — nobody
has to copy your folder into their installation.

It does not go live on its own. These functions run on the server with access to **every** organization
in that Firebase project, so whoever runs `microteia provision` there is shown the files, the npm
packages they add and what kind of function each one is, and approves that exact hash — or passes
`--approve <id>@<hash>` outside a terminal. Until then the extension stays pending, and the Extensions
screen says why. Approval belongs to the project: once one organization's copy carries it, another
organization installing the same version is not asked again.

Change one character in `functions/` and the hash changes: the next version asks for approval again,
and that is the point. Where an installation already has the source — your own, in
`extensions/<folder>/functions/` — that copy wins over the one in the package, so you keep developing
the way you do now.

### A trigger of yours MUST be gated to your extension

A Cloud Function belongs to the **project**. An installation belongs to an **organization**. Nothing in
Firebase reconciles the two, and that gap is not an edge case — it is every project with more than one
organization in it:

```ts
import { onDocumentWritten } from 'firebase-functions/v2/firestore';
import { forInstalledExtension } from 'microteia-functions/office';

export const acmeOnSave = onDocumentWritten(
  { document: 'tenants/{tenantId}/invoices/{id}', region },
  forInstalledExtension('com.acme.crm', async (event) => { /* ... */ }),
);
```

`region` is this installation's, and `create function` fills it in — a trigger declared in another
region never fires, and nothing in the deploy says so.

Without the wrapper that trigger fires for **every** organization in the project: the ones that never
installed your extension, and the one that uninstalled it while another still has it. Uninstalling
cannot save you there — the function has to stay deployed, because somebody else still needs it — and
even when nobody does, it is removed by an administrator running `microteia provision --prune`, which
happens minutes or days after the person clicked Uninstall. The guard is what makes the withdrawal
take effect at the moment it is asked for.

**This is a refusal, not advice.** A Firestore trigger exported from your `functions/` without the
guard is refused before it goes up, and so is one whose guard names a different extension's id — the
copy-and-paste case, where the trigger fires and the handler silently never runs. The refusal is of that
one function: everything else deploys, and the command ends in an error naming it. So a source sitting
in this workspace for an extension nobody has installed blocks nothing — the Console reports it on every
`provision`, and refuses it the day somebody installs the extension and it is asked to go up. The check reads
your source, so the guard may also sit in an identifier beside the trigger
(`const gated = forInstalledExtension('com.acme.crm', handler)`); what it will not accept is a comment
that mentions it.

`npx microteia-plugin create function` asks what sets your function off, and writes the guard for you
when the answer is a saved record.

It costs one cached document read per organization per minute, and it fails closed: an event whose path
carries no `{tenantId}` is skipped and logged.

`isExtensionInstalled(tenantId, pluginId)` is there too, for when you want the answer rather than a
refusal.

### A callable of yours owes three refusals

```ts
import { onCall } from 'firebase-functions/v2/https';
import { requireInstalledExtension } from 'microteia-functions/office';

export const acmeQuote = onCall({ region, cors: true }, async (request) => {
  const { tenantId, ...input } = request.data;
  const uid = await requireInstalledExtension('com.acme.crm', tenantId, request);

  return quoteFor(input);
});
```

The caller signed in, the caller belongs to that organization, and your extension is installed and active
there. It returns the caller's uid.

The middle one is the one that is not obvious, and it is why this is a refusal rather than advice. **The
deploy makes every callable publicly invocable** — it grants `allUsers` the `roles/run.invoker` role
on each one — so what stands between your function and the internet is the Firebase token check and
nothing else. Your screen going away with your extension closes nothing: the endpoint answers ANY
signed-in user of this project, from any organization, whether or not they installed your extension. And
the organization arrives in the **payload**, because `useCallable` sends only what your screen passed —
so without the check, a user of one organization can point your function at another.

It throws rather than returning a boolean, deliberately: a `false` invites being ignored, and the
missing `if` leaves no symptom at all. The errors are `HttpsError`, so they reach your view as errors
and not as a broken response. The check reads the whole file, so the guard may sit in a handler you
extracted — which is what §"Write the handler thin" asks you to do.

**When only some members may do it, ask for the permission in the same call:**

```ts
const uid = await requireInstalledExtension('com.acme.crm', tenantId, request, {
  permission: 'invoices.approve',
});
```

That is the fourth refusal, `permission-denied` naming the permission, and it is the platform's own
rule — the one its screens, its rules and its own functions obey: the member's granted permissions, the
organization's owner, and the platform administrator, who holds every permission in every organization
**without being a member of it**. The second factor the organization requires is checked on the way.

Do not read `tenants/{tenantId}/members/{uid}` to decide this yourself. A copy of the rule has no way to
know the administrator — there is no member document for them — so it refuses them with a 403 in every
organization but their own; and it skips the second factor, so it lets through the session the
organization meant to stop. Both look like correct code until somebody hits them.

The option needs kernel 2.105.0: declare `kernel: '^2.105.0'` or later in your
manifest. An older kernel ignores a fourth argument at run time, and the callable would quietly go back to
asking for membership only.

### A schedule of yours loops over the organizations instead

**First, ask whether you need a function at all.** A routine that reads and writes records on a timer is a
workflow with `eventName: 'schedule'` (§10): the kernel clock runs it in every organization that has it,
stops it when the extension is deactivated, and asks nobody to provision anything. A Cloud Function on a
timer is for what a workflow cannot do — calling an outside service with a secret, say.

A scheduled run, a Pub/Sub message, an HTTP request and a Storage event carry no `{tenantId}` in their
path. There is no organization for `forInstalledExtension` to ask about, and because it fails closed,
wrapping one of these in it leaves your function **inert even while your extension is installed** — it
deploys, it fires, and nothing ever happens. Leaving it unguarded is the other wrong answer: the run acts
on every organization in the project.

```ts
import { onSchedule } from 'firebase-functions/v2/scheduler';
import { forEachInstalledOffice } from 'microteia-functions/office';

export const acmeNightly = onSchedule(
  { schedule: 'every day 03:00', region },
  async () => {
    await forEachInstalledOffice('com.acme.crm', async (tenantId) => { /* ... */ });
  },
);
```

It reads one document per organization, once per run, and asks exactly what the trigger guard asks — a
deactivated extension counts as not installed. It returns how many organizations it ran in. One
organization failing does not take the others' turn: every installed organization runs, and the function
then fails naming the ones that did not, so a bad record in one place cannot silently suspend the routine
everywhere else and a failure cannot pass unnoticed either.

**This too is a refusal.** One of these functions in your `functions/` without the loop is refused
before anything is deployed, and so is a loop that names another extension's id. The check reads the
whole file, not just the call, because the loop legitimately sits inside the handler and may be a couple
of calls deeper.

`npx microteia-plugin create function` writes it for you when you answer "a clock".

Two rules follow from how a Firebase project works, and both are refusals rather than warnings:

- **A `defineString` with no value refuses the deploy of *every* function in the project**, not just
  yours — `firebase-functions` validates parameters globally. The Console lists every one it finds in
  `.env.<projectId>`, empty, so filling it in is the only step left.
- **One installation, one `node_modules`.** Two extensions asking for different ranges of the same
  package is refused, because nothing decides between them. A range the platform already pins is kept:
  the runtime is the platform's choice, and one extension may not move it for the others.

### A function several extensions share

It goes in `../functions/` instead, next to `microteia.yaml`. No single extension owns it, so
**naming one in your `manifest.backend.functions` is refused**: the claim would change nothing while
your extension is installed, and the day it is uninstalled the function turns into an orphan — deleted by
`--prune`, put back by the next deploy, with whoever else depended on it losing their backend in a
window nothing explains. If the function is really yours, move it into your own `functions/`.

What replaces the claim is a declaration of **who it serves**, in `functions/package.json`:

```json
{
  "microteia": {
    "serves": {
      "acmeRecalcTotals": ["com.acme.crm", "com.acme.billing"]
    }
  }
}
```

That single line is what lets the platform treat it like any other extension artifact: it is deployed
while **any** of those extensions is installed somewhere in the project, and withdrawn once none of them
is. Any one of them is enough, and that is the only sensible rule — the function exists because more than
one extension needs it, so requiring all of them would make uninstalling one switch off the others.

Guard the trigger with the same list:

```ts
export const acmeRecalcTotals = onDocumentWritten(
  { document: 'tenants/{tenantId}/invoices/{id}', region },
  forAnyInstalledExtension(['com.acme.crm', 'com.acme.billing'], async (event) => { /* ... */ }),
);
```

**Declared and unguarded is refused** the moment it is deployed, and so is a guard naming an extension
the function does not declare serving: the two lists answer the same question — `serves` decides the withdrawal, the guard
decides the execution — and one of them being wrong makes the function act where it can no longer be
withdrawn. Guarding by just one of the declared extensions is fine; the list is the ceiling, not the
floor.

A shared function with **no** `serves` still works exactly as before: deployed with every
`microteia deploy`, and nothing withdraws it — not even `--prune`. Nothing is refused there either,
because without ids there is no guard to ask for. The Console does list them on every `provision`, so
whoever inherits the installation can see which functions sit outside the mechanism.

### Write the handler thin

A Cloud Function is the one part of an extension that cannot be tried in a second: it is deployed, not
built, and it is deployed into somebody else's project. So keep the handler to what only a handler can
do — refuse the unauthenticated call, read the payload, shape the answer — and put the decision the
function exists to make in a plain function beside it (`create function` writes the `onCall` options,
region included):

```ts
// functions/quote.ts — imports nothing from firebase-functions, so a test can call it
export const quoteFor = (input: QuoteInput): QuoteResult => /* ... */;

// functions/index.ts
export const helloQuote = onCall(options, (request) => {
  if (request.auth === undefined) throw new Error('Sign-in required.');

  return quoteFor(request.data as QuoteInput);
});
```

The handler is then a few lines that can only be wrong in obvious ways, and everything that can be wrong
in subtle ways sits in a file `npm test` covers. It is the same division as a view and its rules (§7),
for the same reason: the part with a name is the part that can be tested.

## 15. Size

| | |
|---|---|
| Warning — from `check` and the app's Create extension screen; it still installs | 400 KiB |
| Refused — by `check`, `build` and the installation | 800 KiB |

A package is stored as a single document. If you are near the limit, the usual cause is code that
should be several extensions, or a seed list that should be data.

## 16. Testing, and asking the installation

`validatePluginPackage` is exported from `@microteia/sdk` — the same function `check` calls. Keeping
it in a test means a broken package fails in a second, on your machine:

```ts
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { buildPlugin } from '@microteia/sdk/node';

it('installs cleanly', () => {
  const built = buildPlugin({ entry: fileURLToPath(new URL('./plugin.ts', import.meta.url)) });
  expect(built.issues).toEqual([]);
});
```

It validates the BUILT package — `buildPlugin` does exactly what `build` does, inlining every
`sourceFile` first, and its `issues` are `validatePluginPackage` over the result. Calling
`validatePluginPackage` from `@microteia/sdk` directly is the same check for a package that is
already built, which an authored one with views or a `startup` list is not.

A report over the screens of SIBLING extensions can be held to them in a test, which makes the warning
above a failure. `packagesSchemaContext` builds the schema of a set of packages — their screens, the
fields one adds to another's screen, their lists — and `undeclaredReportPaths` (or `undeclaredQueryPaths`)
asks the question `check` asks. `catalogSchemaContext` does the same from screens already in catalog form:

```ts
import { packagesSchemaContext, undeclaredReportPaths, validateReportSpec } from '@microteia/sdk';
import { contactsPlugin } from '../contacts/plugin';
import plugin from './plugin';

const ctx = packagesSchemaContext([plugin, contactsPlugin]);

it.each(plugin.reports ?? [])('$key reads only declared fields', (report) => {
  expect(validateReportSpec(report.spec, { schema: ctx })).toEqual([]);
  expect(undeclaredReportPaths(report.spec, ctx)).toEqual([]);
});
```

The MCP server answers from **this installation** rather than from a snapshot of documentation, which
is why it is worth asking before writing:

| | |
|---|---|
| `validate_domain_model` | the domain model, checked deterministically. An ERROR stops the work |
| `generate_artifact_plan` | what must exist, reconciled against what is already here |
| `validate_plugin` | the platform's verdict, after every edit — including every reference to another extension, against what its owner exports |
| `build_plugin` | the `.json`, without writing it |
| `describe_sdk_type` | the exact declaration of any authoring type — `TemplateField`, `WidgetSpec`, `WorkflowStep`, `PluginManifest`, `AuthoredPlugin` |
| `describe_host_module` | what a curated module really exports, for a view or a `startup` |
| `describe_workflow_step` | one step in full: required inputs, accepted mapping kinds, composite shape, outputs |
| `describe_extension` | what ONE extension declares, brings and requires, from the compiled package — how "how is X done?" gets answered without reading a whole `plugin.ts` |
| `read_authoring_guide` | this document, by section |

And one **prompt**, which is the gesture rather than an answer:

| | |
|---|---|
| `model_business_rule` | a business rule arrived. It conducts the order — understand, model, validate, plan — and it is the step people skip |

The order is the point of it. A rule arrives as three lines in a conversation, and the fastest thing to do with
three lines is write a screen. That reading installs and runs, and what it costs is paid later and paid forever.
The prompt puts the sentence itself first: the rule becomes an artifact (`{ id, statement, actors, concepts,
invariants, processes, acceptance }`) before any entity exists, and the `statement` keeps the words it arrived
in — everything after it is a reading, and a reading with no original is traceable to nothing.

Everything that took no argument is a **resource** instead — a document a client attaches and reads,
rather than a tool costing an input schema in every agent's context, in every session:

| | |
|---|---|
| `microteia://entities` | the entities this workspace knows. Read it first, in any modelling task |
| `microteia://domain-model/schema` | the shape a domain model must have |
| `microteia://domain-model/rules` | every check, how each relationship storage is really stored, and the screen rules |
| `microteia://domain-model/coverage` | what the model canNOT say — the mechanisms this platform has and the vocabulary does not reach |
| `microteia://workflow/steps` | the step catalog — every `stepDefinitionId`, what it takes, what it publishes |
| `microteia://workflow/events` | the trigger names, and what `event.` carries in each |
| `microteia://extension-points` | every point, its API version, the impl kinds it accepts |
| `microteia://record-commands` | the record gestures an action may run through `command` |
| `microteia://expression-functions` | the expression functions the installed platform resolves |
| `microteia://referenceable` | every artifact another extension exports that you may point a step at, already in the form the reference takes (§3) |
| `microteia://nav-groups` | every sidebar group this directory can see, by key, with its name in each language and who declares it — read it before declaring a group |
| `microteia://examples` | the first-party extensions in `examples/`, and which mechanism each is the best one to read for |
| `microteia://example-coverage` | every mechanism of this platform against those examples: which have one, which have none, and which are out of reach for an extension |
| `microteia://workspace/plugins` | the extensions authored here, with their current problems and what each one exports |
| `microteia://workspace/info` | what this workspace is bound to |

None of them reads the organization's database: what they know is this directory plus the platform
itself. The rule that decides which list something belongs to is worth keeping: **takes an argument or
changes something, it is a tool; hands back a document, it is a resource.**

### What the organization actually runs

The catalog above is honest about a gap it cannot close on its own. A screen somebody built in the Form
Design, and an extension already installed in the organization, are not in this directory — and a field
called `customerName` is a defect only *because* Customer is a thing. Without them the check that
matters most cannot fire against the entities that matter most.

The server does not close it by talking to the database. `microteia-plugin` is offline by design, and
putting a credential inside the authoring tool would trade a blind spot for something worse. Something
that already talks to the organization exports a **snapshot**, and this directory reads it. There are two
doors, and they write the same file:

- **The application** — on the Extensions screen, **Export catalog** downloads it. It reads as the
  signed-in member, under the same access rules as everything else in the application, so it needs no
  access to the Firebase project: an administrator of the organization is enough. Save the download here
  as `installed-catalog.json`.
- **The Console** — from the installation root (where `microteia.yaml` is), for whoever administers the
  Firebase project:

      microteia export-catalog --tenant <tenantId>

  With no `--tenant` it lists the offices in the project rather than guessing one.

Either way the file carries screens with their fields and record keys, lists of options, tag lists,
which extensions are installed, and **what each of them declares in `manifest.exports`**. It is
**git-ignored**, because it carries screen and field names the organization typed: that is tenant data,
not a product artifact.

The exported surface is what makes §3 usable from here. Without it you knew an extension was installed
and had no way to learn the name of anything inside it — and a name you cannot see is a name you cannot
write. The whole list, from both sources, is the resource `microteia://referenceable`; every answer that
carries a `catalogSources` block repeats it, already in the form the reference takes:

    com.example.utils/normalize-tax-id — Normalize tax id (script)

The `kind` is the part that decides where it fits: a script goes in `scriptId`, an automation in
`targetWorkflowId`. What the artifact DOES never travels — the steps and the code are behaviour, and
the snapshot is shape. The name and the kind are contract.

A snapshot taken by a Console older than this field carries no surface at all, and the answer says so
rather than presenting an empty list as "these extensions export nothing". Take the snapshot again,
through either door.

One thing the snapshot cannot cover, and it is the most common: the extension being authored **beside
yours in this directory**, which is installed nowhere and therefore in no snapshot. Its surface is read
from its own `plugin.ts`, and there an empty `exports` is an answer rather than a silence — the package
is right here.

Three things follow, and they are the point:

- **Every entity says where it came from** — `kernel`, `workspace` or `installation` — and every
  answer that uses the catalog carries a `catalogSources` block saying when the snapshot was taken and
  what it leaves out. A catalog presented as complete when it is not is worth less than none, because
  the reader stops asking.
- **It is a snapshot, and it ages.** Nothing keeps it in step with the organization. After
  14 days the answer says so; anything created there since it was taken is
  simply missing.
- **The workspace wins.** An entity in both the snapshot and a `plugin.ts` here resolves to the one you
  are editing, and the installed copy is dropped whole. That is reported as information, never as an
  error — but it is reported, because what runs there may already have fields your `plugin.ts` does not.

Without the file, everything works exactly as it did before: the catalog is this directory plus the
platform, and it says so.

What it deliberately leaves out, and will not carry — it describes what the entities ARE, and nothing an
organization typed into them:

- records — the catalog describes shape, and a snapshot of an office's data has no business in an authoring directory
- the values inside a list of options or a tag list — that vocabulary is the office's, and the entity catalog never reads it
- members, roles and permissions — who may do what is not part of what an entity IS
- what a workflow, script or action DOES — the steps and the code are behaviour, not shape. What each installed extension declares in `manifest.exports` does travel: that is the surface you may reference, and a name you cannot see is a name you cannot write
- secrets and settings — nothing here should ever hold a credential

### Keep the model on disk

Save it as `<folder>/domain-model.json`. It is not decoration: `source` and `reason` on a snapshot
have nowhere to live in an installed field — the artifact carries a plain column — so without the file
the next session reads the catalog, finds `productName` sitting on an invoice line, and raises it
again. The checks read the file back on their own, which is what makes a declared exception cost one
decision instead of one per session.

**And save the rule beside it, as `<folder>/business-rules.json`.** The plan hands it to you ready to write,
under `trace.contents`, when you pass the `rule`. It records which screens, lists, actions, flows and
permissions that rule produced — and that is the whole traceability mechanism. What it buys is one thing, and
it is large: when the rule CHANGES, the plan is a diff of what that rule generated. Without it, the changed
rule proposes a second batch of screens that look like the first, and "this replaces that" is left to whoever
remembers.

It is a workspace file on purpose. Stamping the rule's id inside the installed artifact would need a new
property on the screen, the action and the flow — the shape of the package changes, and the Kernel contract
moves with it. The question "which screens did this rule create?" is an AUTHORING question: whoever asks it has
the `plugin.ts` open. The organization never asks it, and for them the screen is a screen. It is the same
verdict a declared snapshot exception got, and it has the same consequence: a fresh workspace does not have the
link, which is fine, because a fresh workspace does not have the `plugin.ts` the rule generated either.

The domain model can be tested the same way the package is, and for the same reason — the rule then
fails here, in a second, instead of in someone's organization:

```ts
import { buildDomainCatalog, parseDomainModel, validateDomainModel } from '@microteia/sdk';
import MODEL from './domain-model.json';

it('stays modelled', () => {
  const parsed = parseDomainModel(MODEL);
  if (!parsed.ok) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(parsed.issues));
  const issues = validateDomainModel(parsed.model, buildDomainCatalog()).issues;
  expect(issues.filter((one) => one.severity === 'error')).toEqual([]);
});
```

| `model.key.unknown-field` | error | A key names a field the entity does not have. |
| `model.key.duplicate-name` | error | Two keys of the same entity share a name; the name is what addresses the reservation. |

| `domain.plan.blocked-by-model` | error | The model did not pass validation, so there is no plan. |
| `domain.plan.collection-owned-elsewhere` | warning | The collection is owned by another extension; the plan can only add fields. |
| `domain.plan.deactivate-proposed` | warning | The rule no longer needs something it created; the plan proposes disabling it, never deleting. |
| `domain.plan.list-columns-over-budget` | info | More fields qualify for the list than a row can hold; which ones stay is a human choice. |
| `domain.plan.screen-source-id-missing` | error | A planned screen with no universal identity: the next version installs a second screen instead of updating it. |
| `domain.plan.screen-source-id-divergent` | error | The package declares one sourceId and the ledger records another; the recorded one is the right one. |

| `rule.invariant-not-modelled` | warning | The rule states more invariants than the behavior declares. |
| `rule.process-not-modelled` | warning | The rule states more processes than the behavior declares transitions. |
| `rule.acceptance-missing` | warning | A rule with no acceptance criteria: nothing says whether it was met. |

ERROR blocks the artifact plan; WARNING and INFO do not. Every problem carries a `suggestion` and a
`howToDeclareException` — and where there is no exception, it says so, which is an answer too.

### What the model cannot say, and why that is written down

Of 167 mechanisms this platform has, the model's vocabulary reaches
65 and does not reach 102. Read
`microteia://domain-model/coverage` for the list, item by item, with what each one costs.

| surface | mechanisms | out of reach |
|---|---|---|
| workflow-step | 21 | 9 |
| step-input | 9 | 5 |
| workflow-event | 5 | 3 |
| extension-point | 27 | 26 |
| package-artifact | 15 | 7 |
| screen-property | 37 | 18 |
| action-property | 18 | 12 |
| workflow-property | 14 | 5 |
| manifest-property | 21 | 17 |

That list exists because of one defect and its whole family. A `user-action` transition produced a callable
flow with no description, and without a description the flow is invisible to the step that picks a flow from a
sentence. The model had no way to know — there was no description field — and nobody found out for three
phases. A mechanism with no vocabulary is invisible until somebody trips over it, and the answer to that is not
attention: it is a derived list, checked by a test, so the next one shows up as a failing build instead of as a
surprise.

So when a rule needs one of them — the `query` step, a clock, a page, which record an effect
writes — say so and hand the decision back. Translating it into something that looks similar is the one failure
mode this whole subsystem exists to prevent.

Read `examples/` for first-party extensions in source form — they are the very source that produces
the `.json` the platform installs, so nothing in them is a simplification. Between them they cover
screens, fields, lookups, patches, views wired to pages, `startup`, translation and themes.

Which one, though, is a question the folder names do not answer. `microteia://examples` does: it lists
what is here and says which MECHANISM each one is the best one to read for. And `describe_extension`
answers what any one of them declares, brings and requires without your reading it line by line — the
points it contributes to, the points it declares for others, its screens and collections, its exported
surface, and what it demands of the Firebase project. Neither is prose written beside the code: both
are the package itself, compiled here.

For automation, read `examples/automation-example/` first. It exists for that reason and nothing
else: a workflow triggered by a save, a `Condition` node that branches and converges, a `query`, a
`map` feeding an `upsert` that stays idempotent on a second run, a `workflow.called` flow with
parameters, and an action with `promptParameters` that asks a person before firing. Every id in it is
one `microteia://workflow/steps` would give you, and the package validates — which is the whole point of
reading an example instead of a snippet.
